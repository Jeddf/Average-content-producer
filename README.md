# MINIM

##### Web app displaying most used words across recently published articles

#### Currently works for:
* VICE.com

#### Instructions (Convoluted)
* Run 'python sql.py' to initiate database with schema
* Run 'python run.py' to populate database using cached vice.com feed
* Run 'python routes.py' to start local flask server (WARNING: DEBUG is ON and app is externally accessible)
