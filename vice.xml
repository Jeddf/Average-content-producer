<p>
	On Tuesday, April 29, for the 12th and final feature of <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/come-watch-good-movies-for-once-with-vice-and-the-film-foundation" target="_blank">our screening series with Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s Film Foundation</a> at Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, we&rsquo;re proud to present Alfred Hitchcock&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/movie/shadow-of-a-doubt/" target="_blank"><em>Shadow of a Doubt</em></a>, a morbid portrait of the rotting underbelly of an idyllic small town that is perhaps the darkest of his early movies. Its ideas and influence are everywhere in pop culture; it&rsquo;s responsible for a <a href="http://youtu.be/nM975_Ld9S0" target="_blank">huge</a> <a href="http://youtu.be/i7d0Lm_31BE" target="_blank">chunk</a> of David Lynch&rsquo;s career and Kim Gordon&rsquo;s <a href="http://youtu.be/nWpbFoEUV24" target="_blank">best Sonic Youth song</a>.</p>
<p>
	To get you prepped, we reached out to a bevy of Hitchcock scholars and a Nitehawk staffer and got them to offer up some thoughts on what&rsquo;s widely considered to be Hitchcock&rsquo;s first masterpiece.</p>
<p>
	The screening will preceded by a taped introduction by Martin Scorsese, whose Film Foundation deserves an extra round of applause for its continued efforts at keeping films <em>on</em> film. At a time when the industry is undergoing <a href="http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic235120.files/Rodowick%20Cineaste%20Digital%20Exhibition.pdf" target="_blank">a seismic shift in exhibition format</a> and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579461813982237426" target="_blank">movie theater attendance is dropping</a>, it&rsquo;s almost unheard of to present a 12-film series all on 35mm.</p>
<p>
	Though this marks the end of this series of screenings, we&rsquo;ve always got more stuff going on with Nitehawk. Be on the lookout our <a href="http://www.nitehawkcinema.com/series/vice-news-presents-journalists-in-film/" target="_blank">Journalists in Film series, presented by VICE News</a>, beginning in May.</p>

	<strong>Richard Allen &ndash; </strong><strong>Author of </strong><em><strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hitchcocks-Romantic-Irony-Culture-Series/dp/0231135750" target="_blank">Hitchcock&rsquo;s Romantic Irony</a> </strong></em><strong>and editor of the </strong><strong><a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/distributedpress/12" target="_blank">Hitchcock Annual</a></strong></p>
<p>
	<em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>was Hitchcock&rsquo;s favorite of his films and it&#39;s not hard to see why. His perennial theme of menace and perversion lurking beneath the veneer of middle-class civility and decorum is realized here with pitch-perfect precision. Loosely remaking his third film, <em>The Lodger,</em> <em>Shadow of a Doubt</em> is the first Hitchcock work to fully embrace the American idiom thanks to a felicitous collaboration with Thornton Wilder: The small town ironies of <em>Our Town</em>&rsquo;s unrealized dreams seamlessly harmonize with Hitchcock&rsquo;s morbidly dark comedy. We perceive the insidiously urbane protagonist, Uncle Charlie (Joseph Cotton), largely through the eyes of his double, the restless, spirited Young Charlie (Teresa Wright), who summons him to rejuvenate her boringly mundane familial existence. While Young Charlie slowly and painfully begins to discover the truth about her beloved Uncle, her mother, deliciously played by Patricia Collinge, hangs glutinously upon his every word.</p>
<p>
	Hitchcock weaves expressionist idioms into the visual design of the work to bestow upon Uncle Charlie the menace of a vampire. The suspense kicks in when Uncle Charlie realizes that Young Charlie is the only one who knows the truth about him, while two old men played by Hume Cronyn and Harry Travers (Wilder and Hitchcock?) provide a delightful running commentary on how to perform the perfect murder. Yet <em>Shadow</em>, as Hitchcock&rsquo;s French admirers were the first to realize, adds up to more than the sum of its parts to pose a profound and disquieting moral question: How are we ultimately to distinguish Uncle Charlie from his double, Young Charlie, and what are we to say about the small town in 1943 America that seems so ready to embrace him?</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>William Rothman &ndash;</strong><strong>author of </strong><em><a href="http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5566-hitchcock-second-edition.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Hitchcock: The Murderous Gaze</strong></a></em> and <em><strong><a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-16602-7/must-we-kill-the-thing-we-love" target="_blank">Must We Kill the Thing We Love?: Emersonian Perfectionism and the Films of Alfred Hitchcock</a></strong></em></p>
<p>
	Hitchcock was profoundly attracted to the moral outlook&mdash;rooted in the American Transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau&mdash;that enabled the Hollywood movies of the New Deal era to achieve their rare combination of popularity and seriousness. <em>The 39 Steps</em> followed the lead of <em>It Happened One Night</em>, the monster hit that marked 1934 as the beginning of the period when the Emersonian worldview was ascendant in Hollywood, by concluding with the union of a man and woman that holds a hope of being a relationship worth having. In turn, the brilliant thrillers Hitchcock made in the few years remaining before his departure for Hollywood followed the lead of <em>The 39 Steps</em> by aligning Hitchcock thrillers with American romantic comedies&mdash;but only up to a point. Hitchcock found himself unwilling or unable to abandon himself to the genre&rsquo;s Emersonian outlook, which was already beginning to suffer repression in Hollywood&mdash;as in the nation at large&mdash;by the time David O. Selznick lured him to America. For Hitchcock was no less powerfully drawn to an incompatible vision. He never tired of quoting Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s line, &ldquo;Each man kills the thing he loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What, if anything, legitimizes killing? How, if at all, does the act of killing change the person who performs that act? Every Hitchcock thriller has its own way of posing and addressing these questions, and of thinking through their implications for the &ldquo;art of pure cinema&rdquo; which Hitchcock was both master and slave. But the Nazi menace gave these questions special urgency in Hitchcock&rsquo;s British films of the late 1930s, such as <em>Secret Agent</em>,<em> Sabotage</em>,<em> </em>and <em>The Lady Vanishes</em>, and the films he made in America during World War II like <em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>and <em>Lifeboat</em>, its less celebrated companion piece.</p>
<p>
	<em>Lifeboat </em>calls upon us to ponder the moral difference, if any, between the murder of Gus (William Bendix) by the German Willi (Walter Slezak) and the killing of Willi by the American and British survivors on the lifeboat. Nazis are human beings, just as we are. Can we kill them without becoming like them? <em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>brings the issue home. When Young Charlie discovers that her beloved Uncle Charles, scion of a &ldquo;typical American family,&rdquo; is the moral equivalent of a Nazi, she threatens to kill him if he doesn&rsquo;t leave town. Would there be a difference, morally, between his acts of killing and hers? Hitchcock&rsquo;s judgment is that one is murder, the other not. But <em>Shadow of a Doubt</em> makes clear that the implications of this question are complicated&mdash;and disturbing.</p>
<p>
	For all its philosophical seriousness, it&#39;s also one of his most enjoyable films. The opening sequence takes place in a quintessential film noir milieu&mdash;remarkable, since it predates the genre&mdash;and the action soon moves to a small-town Americana setting reminiscent of <em>Meet Me in St. Louis </em>and <em>Our Town</em>, which isn&rsquo;t surprising, since Sally Benton (who wrote the stories on which Minnelli&rsquo;s beloved musical was based) and Thornton Wilder were two of the film&rsquo;s screenwriters. The third screenwriter was Alma Reville, Hitchcock&rsquo;s wife, which is a key, I suspect, to the film&rsquo;s intimate, warmly humorous and loving, yet also chilling depiction of family life. (In <em>Young and Innocent</em> and <em>Stage Fright</em>, two other Hitchcock films in which family life figures prominently, Alma Reville is credited for &ldquo;continuity&rdquo; and &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; respectively, but <em>Shadow of a Doubt </em>is the only film for which she receives a screenwriter credit.) A host of brilliant actors and actresses bring its finely drawn characters vividly and pleasurably&mdash;and ultimately movingly&mdash;to life. Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotton, Hume Cronyn, and Henry Travers are all flawless, but I rank Patricia Collinge&rsquo;s inspired and haunting performance among the greatest ever brought to the screen.</p>
<p>

<p>
	Relatives are loaded with surprises. Family politics don&rsquo;t get documented like public politics, which makes the record easy to smudge as new generations pop up. Drug problems, failed first marriages, arrests, abuse&mdash;that stuff can be swept away, forgotten, or obscured over time. We put on our best faces for family, but there&rsquo;s always something lingering behind it, some detail that puts your family&rsquo;s perception of you at risk.</p>
<p>
	In <em>Shadow of a Doubt</em>, wanted murderer Charles Oakley blows into his sister&rsquo;s small California town to lay low after strangling three widows on the East Coast. A violent, brooding man, Charles wears the mask of the charming outsider, playfully challenging his family&rsquo;s small-town ways. His sister&rsquo;s family buys into his act fully&mdash;even as he lazily starts to let his mask slip&mdash;all except for his oldest niece, Charlotte, who takes to being called &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; after her uncle.</p>
<p>
	Charles and Charlie share a special bond. They&rsquo;re not psychic, like Charlie suspects, but they can see through the other&rsquo;s acts. Neither of them seems to enjoy the simplicity of small-town existence, but they stick around for different reasons. Charlie loves her family, Charles likes that no one asks any questions.</p>
<p>
	The two spend much of the first half of the film staring side-eyed at one another. Something&rsquo;s off. She knows it and he knows it. Once he&rsquo;s found out, Charles urges his once doting niece to accept his facade. After all, what&rsquo;s real? Everyone hides something, and in small town life, image is everything. But Charlie is shattered when sees that incriminating headline, &ldquo;WHERE IS THE MERRY WIDOW MURDERER?&rdquo; After that, she just can&rsquo;t stop staring at his hands. (Incidentally, that headline reveal drops like a bomb. Hitchcock apparently instructed that the shot feel like a gasp for breath.)</p>
<p>
	References to our natural duplicity pop up throughout <em>Shadow of a Doubt</em>. Charlie&rsquo;s mother doesn&rsquo;t want a shabby sofa to appear in the newspaper because she doesn&rsquo;t want the rest of the country to think they don&rsquo;t have nice furniture. Little Ann calls Charlie out for playing the doting niece to impress her uncle. Charlie&rsquo;s father and his neighbor pass the time playfully planning to secretly kill one another.</p>
<p>
	Charles is right: Everyone holds onto secrets, donning different masks day to day. To him, the past is the past, and we should move on from there. The problem for Charlie is how closely she identifies with her uncle, even after she pegs him as a murderer. If Uncle Charlie is a monster, what does that make her?</p>

<title>James Franco on Teaching, Crying, and Playing a Perv</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/franco-on-teaching-crying-playing-a-perv-in-palo-alto</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 06:23:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/_7Q3oeHsIj0" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	<em>Disclosure: James Franco writes a weekly column for this website. In fact, his latest piece came out today, like ten minutes ago. It&#39;s a fictional script of </em>Three&#39;s Company<em> that ends in a big orgy and you can <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/threes-company-a-play">read it here</a>.</em></p>
<p>
	James Franco hadn&#39;t planned on playing a role in Gia Coppola&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Q3oeHsIj0"><em>Palo Alto</em></a>, the film adaptation of his book, <em>Palo Alto: Stories.</em> Originally, his role was as producer, but when Gia needed someone to play Mr. B, a pervy gym teacher with eyes for April (played by Emma Roberts), an introvert teen on his soccer team, James stepped up to the plate.</p>
<p>
	Coppola&#39;s debut feature is based off of three stories from Franco&#39;s book. Parodying coming-of-age classics, arming characters with smartphones and 21st century slang, Coppola&#39;s treatment of <em>Palo Alto </em>doesn&#39;t bring to mind the mid-90s iteration that Franco initially wrote about in his book. But that doesn&#39;t matter, because the underlying theme of the book, and what comes across on the screen, is the dizzying awkwardness of being a kid in a generic Bay Area suburb with no patience for the future.</p>
<p>
	&quot;To have a completely loyal adaptation without doing anything new would be bizarre,&quot; Franco wrote <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/showing-the-dirty-stuff-in-movies">in a recent article</a> on this website discussing Danny Boyle&#39;s adaptation of <em>Trainspotting</em> for the screen. He went on to explore how sex is being approached by new cinema in films like Lars von Trier&#39;s <em>Nymphomaniac</em> and Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <em>Shame. </em>The topic has surely been on his mind while working on <em>Palo Alto, </em>a project that has forced him to watch characters based on his teenage memories come to life to fuck and emotionally torture each other on the screen.</p>
<p>
	I met up with Franco at a <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/i-went-to-my-first-movie-press-junket">press junket</a> yesterday. Walking into the building felt like wandering Frankfurt&#39;s red light district, but with an appointment confirmed by e-mail. PR girls in matching leather jackets escorted me through dark hotel hallways under low ceilings. I was seated outside of Franco&#39;s room while another interviewer whittled away at my time slot. &quot;It looks like you&#39;re only going to have ten minutes at this point,&quot; the PR girl said. &quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; I said, and she let me in. Here&#39;s how James and I spent those ten minutes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: You had a pervy gym teacher, right?</strong><br />
	<strong>James Franco: </strong>Well, there was a guy at my junior high who the character Mr. B in the movie and the book is loosely based on. So, yeah, I knew a teacher who had a relationship with a 13- or 14-year-old girl. At the time, we were not aware&mdash;it came out after.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You&#39;ve played the jackass rebel kid before, in <em>Freaks and Geeks. </em>Did you decide to play the teacher this time see the other side of things?</strong><br />
	Honestly, I did not intend to play the teacher. I wrote the character, but she [Gia Coppola] selected the stories, so she selected that whole storyline. It didn&rsquo;t necessarily need to be in there. I was the producer, so she would run casting ideas by me. She was running a lot of different ideas for that role by me. I would say, &quot;Oh, yeah, he would be good,&quot; that sort of thing, but in the end she asked me to do it. So, I&#39;m really only in the movie because Gia wanted me in there, and I wanted to do whatever I could to help the movie.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://i7.minus.com/jciNFOuEZblxg.png" style="width: 640px; height: 337px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">James Franco as Mr. B. and Emma Roberts as April</span></em></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s not a role I was dying to play. In fact, I much prefer playing Daniel Desario in <em>Freaks and Geeks</em> to playing the teacher. But I did it to help the movie, and once I committed it was like, well&mdash;I can&#39;t wink at the audience and say, &quot;I know, this guy&#39;s a fuckin&#39; creep.&quot; I had to commit to it and play it so that it would be a genuine portrayal. That being said, I didn&rsquo;t like playing that dude.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Do you cry more as an actor, or did you cry more as a teenager?</strong><br />
	Weird [<em>laughs</em>]. That&#39;s a good question. I&#39;m sure I cried a lot as a teenager in private, but there are certain roles that call for some tears, and I guess I&rsquo;m just used to drawing on those. If you really want to know, it&#39;s not hard for me to cry&mdash;if the material&#39;s right. If the material doesn&#39;t feel genuine, it&rsquo;s so hard for me to cry. But if it&#39;s genuine, and it feels honest, like, I can cry <em>like that</em>.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve got to shoot my friend every night in <em><a href="http://www.ofmiceandmenonbroadway.com/">Of Mice and Men</a></em>. It&#39;s this guy I&#39;ve grown up with, Lenny. I cry almost every night. Not because I&#39;m trying to, it&#39;s just because the material pulls me in, and I hook in emotionally so the tears just come. You know, if you had to shoot your best friend&hellip; so, I probably cry more now. I mean, I cry every night. [<em>laughs</em>]</p>
<p>
	<strong>You&#39;ve taught before, right?</strong><br />
	I still teach. I don&#39;t teach high school. I teach at college. I teach at UCLA, USC, and Cal Arts. I teach graduate film; I teach undergrad writing; I teach a weird kind of performance class at Cal Arts, and it&#39;s great for me. I get to work with very talented people. If students are in those programs, they&#39;re already very accomplished, to a certain extent. So I get to work with very good students and it&#39;s nice to kind of help other people with their work, to not worry about my work, and to get off of myself for a minute. It&#39;s sort of a relief, and it&#39;s a purer space than the professional world. The academic and school space has very little of the business side of things in it. So I like working on projects in a pure space like that.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The art teacher in <em>Palo Alto</em> seems like a cool dude you knew.</strong><br />
	The guy in the movie (Mr. Wilson, played by Don Novello)&mdash;I think Gia played him a little goofier than the guy in the book, and then the guy in the book is <em>loosely </em>based on an art teacher I had. His name was Jim Smith. He didn&rsquo;t teach at high school, he taught at this art league outside of Palo Alto. And yeah! Here was somebody who lived as an artist and was a very accomplished kind of figurative painter, but he certainly wasn&#39;t in the contemporary art scene of New York or LA, or something like that. So I think he was making a lot of his living as a teacher, but it was still impressive that there he was, living as an artist. And that was very influential.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Did you feel like you were properly inside of your book? Like, do you feel like you were in your book?</strong><br />
	Well, it&rsquo;s based on Palo Alto in the mid-90s, which is when I was in Palo Alto as a teenager. So a lot of it is based on experiences that I had, or that other people had, and some of it is made up or fictionalized. But there are a lot of things where I&#39;ve had friends who have gone through it, or friends&#39; parents who have gone through it and been like, <em>Did that really happen? Is that you?</em>&mdash;that kind of thing. There&rsquo;s enough material based on real things that you could play that game.</p>
<p>
	But it&rsquo;s fiction. So, like any writer, I&#39;ve repurposed things, I&#39;ve re-contextualized them and have used them in ways that are different than how they impacted everyone when they really happened. So yeah, I think I&rsquo;m in there. Of course I&rsquo;m in there. There&rsquo;s the character, Teddy, who Jack Kilmer plays that&#39;d I&#39;d say is the most based on me.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://i3.minus.com/jbuKCLE0t8F8zr.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 337px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Nat Wolff as Fred and Jack Kilmer as Teddy</span></em></p>
<p>
	<strong>What about Fred, the crazy rebel character?</strong><br />
	That&#39;s interesting that you bring that up. So Fred, played by Nat Wolff, is a character in the book. But whereas with other characters I can point to people and say, &quot;Oh, she&#39;s based on her, she&#39;s based on her, and he&#39;s based on him.&quot; With Fred, that&#39;s not the case. There is nobody. Fred wasn&rsquo;t based on anyone. Fred came out of my imagination, and once he was on the page, I realized, <em>oh,</em> <em>he&#39;s another side of me</em>. And I basically created him when I was writing the story so that these two sides of myself could talk to each other. So, yeah, in a sense Fred is sort of based on me too. What Gia&#39;s done, is she&rsquo;s combined the Fred in the book with another character in the book, this guy Roberto, so Fred&#39;s a little sleazier than I think I ever was. But yeah, you&#39;re right. I think Teddy and Fred are two sides of me. Generally speaking.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Well, I think they&rsquo;re making us wrap up. Let&#39;s take a selfie?</strong><br />
	Yeah, let&#39;s do it.</p>

<title>Cliven Bundy Is America&#039;s Nightmare and the Republicans&#039; Problem</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/cliven-bundy-is-now-americas-nightmare</link>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150733/ClivenBundy.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 451px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Photo via the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/support.cliven.bundy/photos/pb.277652855730595.-2207520000.1398449282./277653239063890/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank">We Support Cliven Bundy</a> Facebook group</i></p>
<p>
	By now, you have no doubt heard about Cliven Bundy and his <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/an-armed-standoff-in-nevada-is-only-the-beginning-for-americas-right-wing-militias" target="_blank">fight against the Bureau of Land Management</a>. The Nevada cattle rancher&rsquo;s armed standoff against federal agents turned him into an overnight Fox News folk hero, embraced by freedom Republicans like seantors Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and branded a &ldquo;domestic terrorist&rdquo; by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. You are also probably aware that Bundy has revealed himself to be a grade-A racist who thinks black people would be better off in slavery.</p>
<p>
	Sermonizing on his desert homestead, Bundy gave supporters&mdash;and <em>New York Times</em> reporter Adam Nagourney&mdash;a taste of his crackpot worldview, leading with the always-inauspicious phrase &ldquo;I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro&hellip;&rdquo; As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?_r=0">Nagourney reported Thursday</a>, that &ldquo;thing&rdquo; was that one time Bundy drove past a public housing project in Las Vegas, and saw a few black people sitting on the porch. Here&rsquo;s what Bundy said:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have nothing to do. They didn&rsquo;t have nothing for their kids to do. They didn&rsquo;t have nothing for their young girls to do.</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do? [...] They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I&rsquo;ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn&rsquo;t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I really wanted to like Cliven Bundy. I really did. As I wrote earlier this month, the showdown at Bundy Ranch was part of a long-running&mdash;and very relevant&mdash;fight over the federal government&rsquo;s control of land and resources in the West. In Bundy&rsquo;s case, he and other ranchers got shortchanged in the 90s, when the government decided to use the land in question to protect the endangered desert tortoise, ending cattle grazing in exchange for allowing private developers to destroy other tortoise habitats. (Yes, you&#39;re right, that does sound shady.) Bundy stopped paying federal grazing fees in protest, and for the past two decades has been illegally feeding his cattle on public land, racking up $1.1 million in unpaid fines in the process. It&rsquo;s worth noting, though, that even if Bundy had paid, the government still would have forced him to remove his cows from the land, as they did with all of his rancher neighbors. Framed in those terms, it sounded like he had a legitimate beef.</p>
<p>
	Of course, any sympathy I had for Bundy evaporated somewhere between &ldquo;they put their young men in jail&rdquo; and &ldquo;they never learned to pick cotton.&rdquo; It turns out he is just another government-hating bigot with a big gun. You can watch the whole sad spectacle in the <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/04/24/video-cliven-bundys-racist-comments/199008" target="_blank">video</a> below:</p>
<p>

<p>
	There is nothing inherently racist about thinking that federal government shouldn&rsquo;t control nearly 50 percent of the land in Western states. Nor, for that matter, is there anything inherently racist about opposing gun control laws, or wanting to audit the Federal Reserve. But wherever these issues arise, there is invariably a white guy with an American flag and a sidearm that wants to tell you what he knows about &ldquo;the Negro.&rdquo; And what could have been a meaningful, important debate about the size and scope of the federal government turns into yet another rant about black people on welfare and open borders. (Curiously, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/clive-bundy-the-spanish-immigrants" target="_blank">Bundy doesn&rsquo;t seem have a problem with &ldquo;Spanish people.&rdquo;</a>)</p>
<p>
	The conservative push for &ldquo;state&rsquo;s rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;property rights&rdquo;&mdash;and the more extreme &quot;county supremacy&quot; ideas espoused by Bundy and his ilk&mdash;have always been racist dog-whistles, dating back to the fight over slavery, when &ldquo;property&rdquo; was code for &ldquo;enslaved black people,&rdquo; and leading through the Civil Rights Movement, when opposition to desegregation policies became a cornerstone of the modern conservative movement. While the state&rsquo;s rights rallying cry has taken different forms over the years, the laws that conservatives have opposed have almost always been related to race.</p>
<!--recommended--><p>
	In the Obama era, absent any real racial policy agenda from either party, virtually every political issue&mdash;from health care reform to the federal budget deficit&mdash;has taken on racial undertones. A recent <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/obama-presidency-race-2014-4/index1.html" target="_blank">piece by <em>New York</em> magazine&rsquo;s Jonathan Chait</a> delved into this new political reality, citing a 2009 study by political Michael Tesler and David Sears that found that, under Obama, people&rsquo;s feelings about race had bled into everything: If you knew how someone felt about racial politics, you pretty much knew how they would feel about health care reform, a correlation that was stronger in 2009 than in 1993, when Bill Clinton was trying to push through his own health care bill.</p>
<p>
	That doesn&rsquo;t mean, as MSNBC frequently suggests, that white racial resentment and small-government libertarianism are one and the same. But the conservative movement&mdash;and particularly the Tea Party coalition that came out to fight for Bundy Ranch&mdash;is rife with explicitly racist imagery and rhetoric, from signs depicting Obama as a witch doctor to the less subtle <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2012/10/15/racist-t-shirt-at-romney-rally-shows-how-political-events-have-become-harder-to-control" target="_blank">&ldquo;Put the White Back in the White House&rdquo; T-shirt</a> that appeared at a Mitt Romney rally in Ohio in 2012.</p>

	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photo via Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/andrewaliferis/" target="_blank">Andrew Aliferis</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	So pervasive is this bigotry, in fact, that according to this <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0067110" target="_blank">2012 Stanford University study</a>, the longer people are enmeshed in the Tea Party, the more focused they become on their &ldquo;white identity.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not particularly shocking when you consider that activists tuning in to <a href="http://guerillamedianetwork.com/schedule/" target="_blank">Rick Santelli&rsquo;s Guerilla Media Network</a> for Bundy Ranch updates were also treated to a particularly abhorrent rant on &ldquo;Jewish extremism&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zio-globalism&rdquo; from former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;From the beginning, racism has always been part of the Tea Party, starting back with the birther movement,&rdquo; said Devin Burghart, vice president of the Kansas City-based Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, which has been tracking the Bundy Ranch fiasco. &ldquo;And it&#39;s gotten worse, rather than gotten better. You can&rsquo;t say that everyone of them is racist, but the movement is awash in racist rhetoric, and that affects its membership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What makes Bundy&rsquo;s casual racism so treacherous&mdash;apart from all of its obvious terribleness&mdash;is that it&#39;s put an end to a legitimately relevant and important policy debate about the federal government&rsquo;s control of land and resources in the West. No one wants to talk about land policy&mdash;or anything for that matter&mdash;with a guy who thinks that black people were better off as slaves. (Besides that, &quot;Cliven Bundy Is a Terrible Racist&quot; is a much sexier headline than &quot;Let&#39;s Talk About Land Use Policy.&quot;)</p>
<p>
	There are no obvious reasons why black people couldn&rsquo;t support Bundy&rsquo;s position against the federal government. As UCLA constitutional law professor <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/09/the-secret-history-of-guns/308608/%3Fsingle_page=true" target="_blank">Adam Winkler explains</a> in his book, <em>Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America</em>, the modern guns-and-property rights movement has its roots, at least tactically speaking, in the1960s Black Panther Party. Driven by the suspicion that the federal government was unwilling to protect the property rights of African Americans, the Black Panthers taught new recruits that &ldquo;the gun is the only thing that will free us&mdash;gain us our liberation.&rdquo; And while the showdown at Bundy Ranch has frequently been compared to the 1992 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge" target="_blank">Ruby Ridge incident</a>, an equally apt comparison can be made to the 1985 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVE#1985_bombing" target="_blank">police bombing</a> of a Philadelphia row house occupied by members of the black liberation collective MOVE.</p>
<p>
	You can make the argument that certain libertarian positions might appeal to some black voters&mdash;for instance, the government&#39;s mass incarceration of young black men is at least partially to blame for the problems faced by those communities. But <a href="http://goproject.gop.com/" target="_blank">despite the GOP&rsquo;s new push to broaden its support among minority voters</a> in the wake of the disastrous 2012 elections, Republicans didn&rsquo;t do much to help themselves when it came to Bundy. Eager to respond to Sean Hannity&rsquo;s cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre, Paul and Cruz, along with Nevada&rsquo;s Republican Senator Dean Heller and Governor Brian Sandoval, jumped on the Bundy bandwagon, but were shocked, <em>shocked</em> to find out that the longtime county supremacy&ndash;supporting rancher doesn&rsquo;t like black people. This is particularly unfortunate for Paul, who has <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/roadtripping-with-rand-paul" target="_blank">put in some very real efforts trying to win over minority groups</a> on school choice and mandatory minimum sentencing reform, but <a href="http://onpoint.wbur.org/2013/08/06/rand-paul" target="_blank">can&rsquo;t seem to shake his associations to fringy racists</a>.</p>
<p>
	In an ironic twist, Glenn Beck has been the conservative voice of reason on Bundy. The Tea Party media mogul, who recently <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/01/23/glenn-beck-says-he-regrets-helping-tear-country-apart" target="_blank">expressed contrition for his role &ldquo;in helping tear the country apart,&rdquo;</a> has been warning his talk radio listeners about Bundy for weeks.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It is hard, because we believe the government is out of control,&rdquo; Beck said on his program Thursday. But, he added of Bundy, &ldquo;if he really thinks&hellip; that slaves <em>had</em> a family life, just that shows you how unhinged from reality this guy is! You&rsquo;ve got to distance yourself. You must know who you are standing next to at all times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Unless Republicans start taking Beck&rsquo;s advice to heart, Bundy probably won&rsquo;t be the last racist rancher they find themselves standing next to.</p>

<title>Now That It&#039;s Off the Market, Purple Drank Is the New Quaaludes</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/sizzurp-is-the-new-quaalude</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150589/sizzurp.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Image via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmGVZfpk0-g " target="_blank">Youtube user chevyrideronly</a></i></p>
<p class="p1">
	Sizzurp is being pulled from shelves, yes, but don&rsquo;t panic. Not all candy-flavored cough syrups are being taken away from us, and it&rsquo;s not becoming illegal. Not moreso anyway.</p>
<p class="p2">
	The only syrup being taken away, and the only true &ldquo;Lean,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sizzurp,&rdquo; is the one manufactured by Actavis, known as &quot;Prometh,&quot; a variety of promethazine codeine syrup that is purple, usually with an orange label. Sometimes it came with a purple label, and I know hindsight is 20/20, but that purple is much better for branding.</p>
<p class="p2">
	The FDA still allows promethazine, a <a href="http://www.erowid.org/pharms/promethazine/promethazine_law.shtml " target="_blank">regulated, prescription only, un-scheduled drug</a>. So if you can get a prescription for it, and then you mix it with codeine, which is also still legal, you can make genuine and by some accounts legal, though extremely sketchy, dangerous and inadvisable Lean of your own. If you do, you did it of your own accord, not because we told you to, but feel free to let us know how it went.</p>
<p class="p2">
	So while it&#39;s still legal, Actavis nonetheless removed their Syrup from the market. They released a <a href="http:// http://theurbandaily.com/2014/04/23/sizzurp-cough-syrup-off-market/" target="_blank">weirdly masturbatory statement</a>&nbsp;explaining their actions:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p class="p2">
		&quot;Actavis has made the bold and unprecedented decision to cease all production and sales of its Promethazine Codeine product. This attention has glamorized the unlawful and dangerous use of the product, which is contrary to its approved indication.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p2">
	Such a brave pharmaceutical corporation. I&rsquo;m sure it has nothing to do with fear of litigation. They have to pick their legal battles, and fight the ones they can win, like last month&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/actavis-confirms-favorable-ruling-in-generic-celebrex-patent-suit-249943031.html" target="_blank">victory over Pfizer</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	I&rsquo;m reminded of methaqualone, also known as Quaaludes, and its <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19810606&amp;id=0nVaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OAYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6908,2887342" target="_blank">long path to nonexistence</a>. Rorer, Inc. who had sold the Quaalude name to Lemmon in the 1970s commented that because of their double duty as a sleeping pill and a club drug, &ldquo;Quaalude accounted for less than 2 percent of our sales, but created 98 percent of our headaches.&rdquo; After being renamed, and rebranded, they were finally taken off the market voluntarily in 1985, something that makes Actavis&rsquo; decision seem a little less &ldquo;bold and unprecedented,&rdquo; right?</p>
<p class="p2">
	Unlike&nbsp;methaqualone, which faded away when Quaalude, its brand name counterpart, ceased existing, promethazine as a generic is popular in other forms. Phenadoz, for instance, is a suppository version of promethazine you can still get a <a href="http:// http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-76338-Phenadoz+Rect.aspx?drugid=76338&amp;drugname=Phenadoz+Rect" target="_blank">prescription</a> for.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150594/Screenshot-2014-04-24-15-10-06.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 425px;" /><br />
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Image via <a href="http://instagram.com/souljaboy" target="_blank">Soulja Boy&#39;s Instagram</a></i></p>
<p class="p2">
	Is promethazine so popular that it will endure after its most convenient form was pulled from pharmacies? Will Justin Bieber resort to sticking it in his butthole now that he can no longer drink it? I asked an anonymous user to give me his account of a Lean experience. Funnily enough, it sounds a lot like Quaaludes, as described by Leonardo DiCaprio in<em> The Wolf of Wall Street</em>:</p>
<p class="p2">
	He told me, &quot;You get really sleepy but if you fight the urge to sleep its a really crazy high. It didn&#39;t work for me, but the guy I did it with was a pizza delivery driver and he would always keep a 2 liter of 7up in his car during his shifts. He would put about 1/4 of a bottle of cough syrup in the 7up with a handful of jolly ranchers and drink that all night. Then he would basically show the symptoms of a drunk person but with more slurred speech. I don&#39;t know how he&#39;s still alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Much like Jordan Belfort hoarding discontinued Quaaludes, Soulja Boy has reassured fans that he still has sizzurp. He wrote <a href="http://instagram.com/souljaboy">on Instagram</a>, &quot;Soulja got the juice. They say the streets dry. I say you gotta be kiddin me. I serve everybody.&quot;</p>
<p class="p2">
	So sizzurp, with its newfound position as an exotic novelty, is poised to become the new Quaaludes. Despite not being all that great, it&#39;ll go for exorbitant prices, and only the rich and well-connected will be able to get their hands on it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/23/sizzurp-cough-syrup-off-market-justin-bieber-lean-codeine-actavis/#ixzz2zjhYQv64" target="_blank">TMZ</a> (for what it&rsquo;s worth)&nbsp;says &quot;one prominent rapper has already offered his dealer up to $100,000 to get whatever he can.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150593/2294973605-a54f3acb49-o.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />

<p class="p2">
	But for all I know, online retailers are still stocked up. Sites like <a href="http://actavispromethsyruponline.com">actavispromethsyruponline.com</a>&nbsp;are still running, although judging from the snowflake-intensive graphic design, they haven&#39;t updated their site since the holidays. What&#39;s more though, the kids can still get into plenty of trouble on dextromethorphan cough syrup, which is available over-the-counter.</p>

<title>Is al-Shabaab Responsible for the Latest Bombing in Nairobi?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/pangani-police-station-nairobi-kenya-bomb-attack-wil-crisp</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 17:35:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150632/IMG-2561.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	By the time I get to Pangani police station in Kenya&#39;s capital, Nairobi, the clean-up is well underway. What&#39;s left of the taxi has been towed into a corner, leaving a large dark stain marking the spot where it exploded, right in the middle of the entrance to the car park and just yards from the door of the police station.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You should have been here a couple of hours ago,&rdquo; says Wilson, an engineering student and one of dozens of Nairobi residents who are crowding around the police station. Wilson tells me that he was on his way into the center of town when his bus had to stop due to wreckage blocking the road. &ldquo;It was a real mess,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There were bits of car everywhere, and bits of people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There was a man&#39;s head lying right here,&rdquo; he says, taking me along the edge of the road and pointing to a hedge growing about 25 yards from the spot where the bomb went off. &ldquo;The distance shows you how powerful the explosion was,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>
	Another man joins us. He tells me his name is Amos and he sells heating systems for houses. &ldquo;I didn&#39;t see the head, but I did see bones,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Bits of meat were lying all across the road like chicken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The taxi that exploded was stopped by police officers at 8:00 PM on Wednesday night on a highway about a mile away from the police station.&nbsp;According to the police,&nbsp;the taxi was stopped because&nbsp;it was driving on the wrong side of the road. Two policemen took control of the car and escorted it and its driver and his passenger back to the station for questioning, with another police car following behind. When the&nbsp;taxi&nbsp;got to the police station the bombs&nbsp;inside it&nbsp;were detonated, killing the two police officers and two suspects inside the vehicle.</p>
<p>
	Two improvised bombs were used in the suicide attack, according to Joseph Mutoa, a spokesperson for the police. &ldquo;It&#39;s not confirmed yet, but looking at the facts it must be the work of al-Shabaab. It&#39;s obvious. No one else would do it like this,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150634/IMG-2558.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	Outside the police station the crowd buzzes with speculation as to who committed the attack and why. Some in the crowd say the attack targeted the police because many radical Muslims blame police officers for the extrajudicial killing of&nbsp;Makaburi, a preacher who promoted al-Shabaab. He&nbsp;was found&nbsp;<a href="http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-161436/radical-preacher-makaburi-shot-dead" target="_blank">shot dead</a> on April 2, a couple of days after&nbsp;he&nbsp;publicly defended&nbsp;the Westgate terror attack.</p>
<p>
	Some point out that al-Shabaab had <a href="http://nairobinews.nation.co.ke/were-coming-to-blow-up-nairobi-al-shabaab-warn/" target="_blank">threatened</a> a terror attack just a couple of days before, posting a video online that said &quot;Westgate is not enough&quot; and boasting that there are &quot;hundreds of men who are waiting to be part of a similar operation.&quot; Others argue that it can&#39;t be al-Shabaab, as the group normally claims all of its attacks.</p>
<p>
	Many&nbsp;of those in the crowd&nbsp;are preoccupied by the ongoing heavy-handed crackdown on Somali migrants and say the attack is retaliation for police brutality and deportations. According to the interior ministry, almost 4,000 people were detained between the 2nd and 9th of April as part of the anti-terror Operation&nbsp;Usalama Watch, with hundreds held in the&nbsp;Kasarani&nbsp;football stadium in conditions described by the UN&#39;s refugee agency as&nbsp;&quot;overcrowded&rdquo; and &ldquo;inadequate.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The police claim the continuing operation is targeting suspects regardless of race, but human rights organizations are critical and <a href="https://news.vice.com/articles/the-mob-justice-of-kenyas-somali-stop-and-frisk" target="_blank">say</a>&nbsp;police officers are systematically detaining&nbsp;Somalians, many of whom have no connection to terrorist activities. Over the last month police officers&nbsp;have been accused of&nbsp;conducting raids without&nbsp;proper documentation, looting, beating people up, and extorting bribes.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150636/IMG-2554.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	On April 11 the&nbsp;police station that was bombed in Pangani was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hrw.org/news/2014/04/11/kenya-halt-crackdown-somalis" target="_blank">highlighted</a>&nbsp;in a Human Rights Watch report&nbsp;as a location where&nbsp;officials&nbsp;were abusing prisoners. The organization said it found&nbsp;&ldquo;hundreds of detainees packed into cells designed to accommodate 20 people. Detainees had no room to sit, and the cells were filthy with urine and excrement.&rdquo; Officials from Human Rights Watch witnessed police officers &ldquo;whipping, beating, and verbally abusing detainees&rdquo; inside the police station. They also said they found detainees who had been held in the cells for up to eight days without being taken to court&mdash;far longer than the country&#39;s 24-hour legal limit.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It was a trap,&rdquo; says Tony, a taxi driver who lives near the Pangani area. &ldquo;Why else would the taxi have been driving on the wrong side of the road? The driver wanted to be stopped by the police&nbsp;so he could try to blow up the police station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The bombing is the latest in a string of unclaimed attacks in Kenya, and it&#39;s the second time in two months that police have accidentally escorted a large bomb to one of their police stations. The first was on March 11, when a Toyota 4x4 was confiscated from a Somali man and parked outside a police anti-terror office in the port city of Mombasa. Over a week later the vehicle was searched by foreign counter terrorism agents who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/kenya/10709065/Kenyan-police-park-massive-car-bomb-outside-their-offices-after-missing-explosives-in-vehicle.html" target="_blank">found</a> that six pipe bombs were welded to the vehicle&#39;s back seats.&nbsp;According to Kenyan police the bombs were already attached to a mobile phone detonator and contained enough explosives to destroy a multi-story building.</p>
<p>
	As the crowd mills around waiting for something to happen outside Pangani police station, a black 4x4 rolls up containing the local MP for the&nbsp;Kamukunji&nbsp;area, Hassan Yusuf, who proceeds to&nbsp;give an impromptu press conference.</p>
<p>
	His theory about the true intentions of the bombers differs to Tony&#39;s. During his press conference he says the attack&#39;s true target was a live television debate about national security due to take place in the Eastleigh area, that was going to be attended by senior political figures including Kenya&#39;s top policeman, Inspector General David Kimaiyo.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The car was deemed suspicious and was stopped,&rdquo; he says. He goes on to applaud the police for taking action and says that, although two officers died, their actions prevented a major terror attack that would have claimed many more lives. &ldquo;This is what we want. We want terrorism to be prevented by the police and this is a good example of what they can do,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p>
	Though the crackdown on Somali migrants is popular with Kenyans who&nbsp;are&nbsp;increasingly encouraged to&nbsp;associate Somalians with terrorism, outside Kenya Operation Usalama Watch&nbsp;is exacerbating concerns about a widening divide between Somali Muslims and Kenyan Christians.</p>
<p>
	Cedric Barnes, project director for the International Crisis Group&#39;s Horn of Africa project, says continuing persecution is likely to ultimately benefit al-Shabaab, and that the government should focus on unifying the two communities. &ldquo;Blanket actions that look like collective punishment of a particular minority and faith group can only marginalize and radicalize,&rdquo;&nbsp;he says.</p>
<p>
	As we poke around the bits of car that have been swept to the corner of the police station parking lot, Wilson and Amos argue about how the threat from&nbsp;terror attacks&nbsp;should be countered. Both agree that security is getting worse in Kenya and expect&nbsp;increasingly&nbsp;frequent&nbsp;attacks in the future, but they can&#39;t agree&nbsp;on&nbsp;how the attacks should be prevented.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The Kenyan&nbsp;military&nbsp;needs to withdraw from Somalia and increase security in Kenya,&rdquo; says Wilson. He says the attacks only started to pick up pace after the Kenyan army began operations in Somalia back in October of 2011.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This won&#39;t stop if we pull out of Somalia,&rdquo; Amos counters. &ldquo;Somalia is our neighbor, and as long as al-Shabaab is allowed to use it as a stronghold we&#39;ll always see attacks in Kenya.&rdquo;</p>

<p align="center">
	We open on the living room set of <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>. A couch is in the center of the room, facing out toward the audience, with a 70s-era television in front of it. Doors lead off to the non-existent kitchen, bedrooms, and outdoor areas. All action outside of the living room set will take place downstage. JACK, a bachelor in his late 20s, sits on the couch watching TV. A screen hanging at the back of the stage displays what Jack is watching on the TV.&nbsp; The opening credits for <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em> appears on the screen, and the theme song starts, &ldquo;Come and knock on our door&hellip;&rdquo; The volume is lowered a bit, but the images continue to play. It&rsquo;s an episode called &ldquo;Home Movies.&rdquo; Eventually this will start be intercut with recreations of three episodes.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Laughing at the TV]<br />
	Oh man, they don&rsquo;t make television shows like they used to.&nbsp; [Laughs some more.&nbsp; Then he notices the audience] Oh, hey. I guess you&rsquo;re here for a show. [Pause. He looks around] Am I the show? I guess you don&rsquo;t want to watch me watching television.&nbsp; But, damn, this was a good show. <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>, you ever watch it? I know, you&rsquo;re probably thinking, that sexist show about a sex-crazed man and two bimbos in short shorts and tight tops, one dumber than the other, sexual content, homophobic jokes, nagging wives, and stupid physical comedy? EXACTLY. It was the sitcom that defined all sitcoms, because it didn&rsquo;t shy away from our favorite subject&mdash;sex! We want the boys and girls to chase each other around.&nbsp; From Jane Austen to Entourage, relationships have always been important in entertainment. Television may have eroded our standards by forcing shallow love down our throats, but it&rsquo;s also done wonders.&nbsp; &ldquo;The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom&rdquo;&mdash; thanks, Oliver Stone. Back in the days of George Eliot you couldn&rsquo;t get the number of marriage plots you can now, because you only had novels and plays. Now you&rsquo;ve got hundreds of channels, movies, memes, blogs, videogames&mdash;this could go on for a while. Our representations of ourselves have been exhausted. That&rsquo;s the difference between television and&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;movies or books or plays; television shows can take a genre and run it into the ground.&nbsp; Just look at cop films now and how they struggle to become something more than just a special episode of NYPD Blue. You look at how movies have reacted to television over the years and the impulse is to always go bigger, louder, more blood, bigger budgets. Let&rsquo;s add aliens, say &ldquo;fuck&rdquo; or &ldquo;cunt.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s make those people naked, if it had nothing to do with the plot. But it all runs together on the internet anyway, and soon enough&mdash;it&rsquo;ll just run through our bodies.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	[Walks in. She is dressed in short shorts. She sits on the couch next to Jack.]<br />
	Who were you talking to?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Oh, no one.&nbsp;<br />
	[Winks at audience]<br />
	I was just watching <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	What are you talking about?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	<em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>?&nbsp; With John Ritter, Susanne Summers, Don Knox as Ferley and the brunette, um, what&rsquo;s-her-name. . .</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Joyce DeWitt!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Oh, that&rsquo;s right!&nbsp; Sorry, Janet.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	So, why the heck are you watching <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>, we&rsquo;re in <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	It&rsquo;s my favorite show! I think it&rsquo;s fucking hilarious. That idiot guy that trips all over the place trying to screw those bimbos all the time.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Jack. That idiot guy is you.&nbsp;And that bimbo is me.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Janet. You shouldn&rsquo;t talk about yourself that way. I know you just work in a flower shop, but you are more than just a bimbo.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	I know you blockhead! I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m a bimbo, you and the rest of the male species does because of shows like the one you&rsquo;re watching. I&rsquo;m not saying that I&rsquo;m really a bimbo, I&rsquo;m saying that that&rsquo;s us on the show.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you recognize yourself?</p>
<p>
	[Jack looks closer at the screen.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Holy Shit. That is us.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Doi-hicky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	What-the-fuck? I&rsquo;m so funny.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You&rsquo;re not, that&rsquo;s John Ritter. He plays you. He was the funny one, or pretty funny. Now you&rsquo;re being played by _____________[First and last names of actor playing Jack]. You&rsquo;re not so funny.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Hey, ____________[first name of actress playing Janet] slow down; don&rsquo;t switch personalities on me. I just found out that I&rsquo;m watching myself on television.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	I&rsquo;m clarifying.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	By calling me by my real-real name?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You do know you&rsquo;re in a theater, right?&nbsp; That people are out there watching you?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Looks out at the audience as if for the first time]<br />
	[Whisper]<br />
	Yes, I fucking know that _____________[first name of actress playing Janet], I mean Janet. But I don&rsquo;t want to think about that. Stop thinking about that. You need to focus, react to me.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	What did they teach you that in acting class?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Actually, yes. &ldquo;Work off the other person.&rdquo; You should only be focused on me, forget the audience.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Well, I think you&rsquo;re full of fucking shit, because I heard you talking to someone, and I think you were talking to them.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Feigns shock]<br />
	_____________ [Name of actress playing Janet], I mean Janet! Watch your mouth. You can&rsquo;t swear.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You swore.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	No, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	___________ [Actor paying Jack), you fucking swore!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That was before I knew we were on TV. I just don&rsquo;t want our show to be pulled off the air for vulgarity.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	____________(Actor paying Jack), we&rsquo;re not on TV, we&rsquo;re in a fucking theater.&nbsp; We can swear as much as we want.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	I know where we are. We ALL do. I do, you do, the audience does. You&rsquo;re not being special or crazy by being all Meta, Joyce? We are all aware, but in this space, we are creating magic by all playing by the rules. That&rsquo;s how this works&mdash;suspended disbelief. Would you like it if the audience stopped playing by the rules, if they threw beer bottles at us or just came on stage and started &ldquo;acting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You called me Joyce.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Looks confused]</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Just a second ago, you said, &ldquo;You&#39;re not being special or crazy by being all Meta, Joyce.&rdquo;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not Joyce. Joyce DeWitt was on the original show and is still alive.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	What the fuck do you expect? You screwed up all levels of reality, or smooched them together, and now you expect me to figure out what to call you?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Whatever, Jack. I&rsquo;ll play along, but you gotta tell me why you how you&rsquo;re watching yourself on television.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	It was just on. I guess we just all watch ourselves now that it&rsquo;s the 2000s.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Yeah, you&rsquo;re right. Back in the 80s, I used to think about this set we&rsquo;re in, a living room with a couch facing a television looking toward an audience that was also in the same set, a living room with a couch facing a television. It was like a fucked-up mirror. Did they just sit around and watch us be stupid, then turn around and do the same thing. Well, except we didn&rsquo;t have consequences.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Or pussy.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Jack!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Well, we didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It was so frustrating. You and Chrissy walked around offering the goods on a platter. Larry and I got nothing. Not once.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Well, that was the appeal of the show.</p>
<p>
	[CHRISSY walks in wearing a revealing outfit, holding a video camera.&nbsp; She is beautiful and blonde, acting ditsy. blond and pretty and acts ditsy.]</p>
<p>
	[Canned applause.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	What was the appeal of what show?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	You. Your boobs.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Jack!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Jack, don&rsquo;t be mean.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	I&rsquo;m only telling the truth</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Why would you say something like that?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Your boobs and legs are the only thing anyone is looking at right now!</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Oh, duh, I know that. That&rsquo;s why I wear this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m saying that you&rsquo;re a liar because I&rsquo;m not on any show.&nbsp; Why would you say something like that?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Chrissy, you are. Look!</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	[Looking at the TV]<br />
	What the heck is that?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	It&rsquo;s us, it&rsquo;s a TV show about us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called <em>Three&#39;s Company</em>.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	No, that outfit I&rsquo;m wearing. It&rsquo;s so 80s.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Yeah, it was the 80s, early 80s.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	What the heck are you talking about Jack?&nbsp; And who is &ldquo;Three&rdquo; and what&rsquo;s his company make?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Huh?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	You said it&rsquo;s called <em>Three&rsquo;s Company</em>, who is Mr. Three?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	No, Chrissy, the apostrophe-s is not possessive, it&rsquo;s contraction for &ldquo;three IS company.&rdquo; Meaning the three of us.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Why don&rsquo;t they just say that then?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	It&rsquo;s just a play on the saying:&nbsp; One&rsquo;s fun, two&rsquo;s company, three&rsquo;s a crowd. Three isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, and maybe we should&rsquo;ve all been boning. Laying pipe.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	We&rsquo;re a sex company?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	No, Chrissy. Company, as in companionship. Well, Jack thinks it means menage a trois.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	A massage company?<br />
	[They roll their eyes.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Yes, a massage company. Now let&rsquo;s get started.<br />
	[He spreads his legs.]</p>
<p>
	JANET/CHRISSY<br />
	Jaaack!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Actually, I shouldn&rsquo;t do that.&nbsp; There was a famous episode where you could see Jack&rsquo;s balls because his shorts were so short.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	And they aired it?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	They had two versions, one where they kept it and one where they edited it out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY/JANET<br />
	Jack!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Tell me I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	No, he&rsquo;s kinda right.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Yeah, I guess so.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	OK, but I&rsquo;m still confused.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That&rsquo;s a first.<br />
	[Janet hits Jack playfully.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Tell me what this TV show is about.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	It&rsquo;s about us. In the first episode, I came over for your old roommate&rsquo;s birthday party and I fell asleep in the bathtub.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	You were so drunk!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	You needed a new roommate, but back then I guess guys and girls weren&rsquo;t allowed to rent an apartment together.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Back in the prude eighties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Exactly. Silly premise, but that&rsquo;s why I pretended to be gay, because the Ropers wouldn&rsquo;t let me stay otherwise, and it opened the door for a bunch of homophobic jokes. It was great fun back in the 80s when people still thought it was funny to say &ldquo;fairy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tinkerbell&rdquo; and even &ldquo;faggot,&rdquo; but I don&rsquo;t think it really flies today.&nbsp; Especially now that we&rsquo;re in a theater and not on the TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	What do you mean?&nbsp; Gay people don&rsquo;t watch TV.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	But straight people don&rsquo;t go to the theater.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Wait a minute. You&rsquo;re not gay?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	NO! I was just pretending.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	But there is a little bit of truth in every joke, Jack, even I know that.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	But I wasn&rsquo;t joking! I was pretending, so that I could stay here and try to screw the both of you. Maybe we should just move on.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	So, what do you think we&rsquo;re supposed to do now? We can&rsquo;t just keep talking about the meta aspects and post-modern aspects of our situation. I mean we&rsquo;re in a theater, with an audience, watching us, waiting for us to entertain them.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Wait! We&rsquo;re in a theater? Like an old-fashioned theater, where the actors act on a stage and there are real people out in the audience?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Yes.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Like in elementary school, when I played Eeyore?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You played Eeyore?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Yeah, my tail kept falling off and those boys all wanted to keep pinning it back on.&nbsp; They were so helpful.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	I guess Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, TIgger, and Christopher Robbins decided not to be gay after all.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Wait, what?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	All those characters. They were gay as hell.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Why do you say that?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Just look at them, they all look super feminine and cuddly, rolling around in the grass together, fucking, and bouncing, and playing with butterflies.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Because you look like a girl doesn&rsquo;t mean your gay. And those boys were attracted to Chrissy dressed as a boy, so what does that say? They wanted Chrissy to use a strap on?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are we going to talk about ball gags next?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You&rsquo;re the one who called imaginary talking animals gay.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Yeah, but Eeyore with a strap-on?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	And how the heck did you know they had to get me an extra strap for that costume?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	No, not an extra strap, a strap . . .</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	My costume kept falling off because the boys were putting that tail on so hard, my costume kept ripping off.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Fine. And my point is that if all actors are gay, so are all cartoon characters, and children&rsquo;s book characters. And I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing,<br />
	[His voice gets louder]<br />
	I hate fucking screenwriters, playwrights, and directors of all sorts, film, television, theater, or otherwise.</p>
<p>
	[The girls take a step back.]</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Ummm...</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[He composes himself.]<br />
	I&rsquo;m just saying. You want to talk about what&rsquo;s primary in entertainment, it&rsquo;s the fucking performers. We are the life! Writers that get all hung up about their words or directors that get all hung up on their blocking, fuck &lsquo;em. An actor can convey a world of emotion in a five seconds that would take a novelist pages to describe. And TV writers are even worse, they underline words and italicize them, and if the actor doesn&rsquo;t emphasize that word they cut the take. What the fuck is that? Why don&rsquo;t they just work in animation?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	There are words italicized in this script.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Shut up. Did I stop you when you fucked up those lines back there?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Which lines?!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	We were supposed to be talking about the audience by now. Back when you started talking about Eeyore and strap-ons.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Sorry! It was the only play I&rsquo;d ever done, I thought it was important. Especially because it was the first disguise I wore when my mom and I started robbing banks.</p>
<p>
	[Silence.]</p>
<p>
	[Jack and Janet look at each other.]</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You and Mrs. Snow robbed banks?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Oh yeah, it was so fun. I&rsquo;d go in first dressed as Eeyore, or Snoopy, or sometimes Scooby Doo and I&rsquo;d walk in all innocent and everyone would think it was a big joke and then I&rsquo;d walk right up to the guard and shoot him right in the balls. It was like a game.</p>
<p>
	[Silence.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Right. Well, maybe we should get back on script. [Pulls a script out from between the pillows of the couch]. It says right here [Jack reads from the script] Chrissy moves to the foot of the stage and looks out at the audience.&nbsp; She peers into the darkness. Chrissy says, &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; The audience titters. Chrissy peers more. Then she sees them. She gasps, &ldquo;Oh my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	OK, OK, OK! I remember. Sorrr-eeeeeee.<br />
	[Chrissy moves to the foot of the stage and looks out at the audience.&nbsp; She peers into the darkness.]<br />
	Hello?</p>
<p>
	[The audience titters.&nbsp;Chrissy looks back at Jack.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Isn&rsquo;t the audience supposed to titter?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Don&rsquo;t worry about that part. It&rsquo;s interactive. It&rsquo;s also a way to let them know we&rsquo;re thinking about them. Whether they titter or not doesn&#39;t matter. We&rsquo;re just letting them know that they are playing roles too.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	I thought you forgot about the audience when you acted.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Yeah, but not when I&rsquo;m the playwright.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You wrote this?!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Shhhhhhhh. You&rsquo;re interrupting Chrissy.&nbsp; [To Chrissy] Go on, Chrissy, sorry we interrupted.</p>
<p>
	[Chrissy peers more. Then she sees them.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	[Gasps]<br />
	Oh, my God!<br />
	[She points out at the audience and looks back at Jack.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	[Whispers]<br />
	They&rsquo;re out there.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Whispers]<br />
	I know!</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	[Whispers]<br />
	Well, what are we supposed to do?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Whispers]<br />
	They want to be entertained. They want to laugh. They want to think.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Don&rsquo;t get carried away.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	[Whispers]<br />
	OK, they want to laugh; they want you to entertain them.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	[Chrissy turns back to the audience. She tentatively waves.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Hi.</p>
<p>
	[The audience waves back.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	[To Jack]<br />
	Aren&rsquo;t they supposed to wave back?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	I told you, don&rsquo;t worry about that.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	OK, but I&rsquo;m just trying to entertain them.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	I&rsquo;m sorry, but Chrissy just waving at the audience isn&rsquo;t entertaining.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	It might be. All they want is a little attention. That&rsquo;s all that Marina Abromavic did when she sat across from everyone in the MoMA; she gave them a little attention, and everyone treated her like a goddess. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	You&rsquo;re saying you&rsquo;re like Marina Abromavic?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Yeah. Performance art.</p>
<p>
	[Chrissy keeps waving.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Except that I&rsquo;m bringing the sexy edge to performance art.<br />
	[She cocks sexy poses and waves. This continues for a while.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Chrissy, that&rsquo;s enough. They&#39;re ready for some ENTERTAINMENT.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Well, I&rsquo;m not stripping if that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re expecting.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That&rsquo;s a good idea, but I&rsquo;ll do the stripping. If a girl strips it&rsquo;s pornographic, if a guy strips it&rsquo;s artistic.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Um, I guess.<br />
	[Jack stands and pulls his shirt off.]</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Jack! Cut it out.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Why?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Because. We need to get serious, we have a whole theater full of people here. We have to DO SOMETHING.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	What do you think I&rsquo;m doing?</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Acting like an ass.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	I thought he was stripping.</p>
<p>
	[Jack and Janet look at each other.&nbsp;Chrissy walks over to the couch and sits.]</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Well, what do you want to do?</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Let&rsquo;s think.</p>
<p>
	[Jack and Janet join Chrissy on the couch, all of them thinking.]</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Well, at least this is new. No one has ever thought on stage for such a long time.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	I have an idea.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Uh oh.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Shut up, Jack.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Yeah, shut up Jack. I&rsquo;m not dumb. When my first boyfriend called me dumb I stabbed him in his sleep, cut off his cock, and left it in his mouth.</p>
<p>
	[Silence.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That&rsquo;s great Chrissy. I don&rsquo;t think you should really be talking about all that stuff.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	I thought you said you wanted drama.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Yes, but that&rsquo;s just creepy backstory, we need something to happen now.</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Well, I have this video camera.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Where did that come from?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	I walked in with it. I sorta thought it could be like the Checkov thing with the gun, like don&rsquo;t introduce it unless you are going to use it. Like in The Seagull.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Now that&rsquo;s a brilliant fucking idea. Fuck, YES. Let&rsquo;s make a video and then we can show it to the people. They&rsquo;ll love it! That&rsquo;s all anybody wants to watch nowadays, videos!</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Ooh, ooh, ooh, let&rsquo;s do a musical number! Let&rsquo;s do a musical number.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	This isn&rsquo;t a musical.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Who cares, Jack? You said it yourself, these people want to be entertained. Let&rsquo;s entertain them. They all pretend to be into high culture and into the theater but they just want a bunch of song and dance and celebrities. Let&rsquo;s do a play about the making of a video.</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That&rsquo;s it? That&rsquo;s all you want to do?</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY<br />
	Yeah, I&rsquo;m a good singer and a good dancer.</p>
<p>
	JANET<br />
	Me, too! Me, too!</p>
<p>
	[Jack picks up the camera.]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	You&rsquo;re sure?</p>
<p>
	JANET/CHRISSY<br />
	Yes!!!!!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	OK! I have the best fucking song!</p>
<p>
	[He turns on the stereo.&nbsp;SELENA GOMEZ &amp; THE SCENE&rsquo;S &ldquo;LOVE YOU LIKE A LOVE SONG&rdquo; comes on.&nbsp;The GANG SINGS ALONG and DANCES. As they do so Jack moves about them and video tapes them. The video stream plays on the screen.]</p>
<p>
	GANG<br />
	[To the music sings and dances &ldquo;Love You Like a Love Song.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	That was FUCKING GREAT!</p>
<p>
	CHRISSY/JANET<br />
	Yeah!</p>
<p>
	JACK<br />
	Let&rsquo;s do it again, and turn up the heat!</p>
<p>
	[More screens descend and more dancers come out on stage.&nbsp;JUSTIN BIEBER&rsquo;S &ldquo;BABY&rdquo; plays and the gang sings along.&nbsp;Now there are multiple cameras and a fancy light show that are projected on the screens. The new dancers do a choreographed dance.]</p>
<p>
	GANG<br />
	[Sings &ldquo;Baby.&rdquo;]</p>
<p>
	[After the song is over, there is a big orgy on the stage behind the couch.&nbsp; It can&rsquo;t be seen from the audience but parts of it are displayed on the screens.]</p>

<title>Why Do Young Australians Love the Monarchy So Much?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/young-australians-just-love-the-monarchy</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150327/MAIN.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 390px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Emelia, Harry, Jacqui and Grace, who said, &quot;Baby George is so cute&quot;</i></p>
<p>
	If it weren&#39;t enough that Australia has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/australia-brings-back-knights-and-dames-critics-call-them-a-royal-embarrassment/2014/04/18/af168028-c578-11e3-8b9a-8e0977a24aeb_story.html" target="_blank">knights and dames again</a>, we&#39;ve now had a Royal Visit. Prince William, Princess Kate, and Baby Prince George just left our fair country after a busy tour of Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and Uluru to the delight of hundreds of Australian monarchists and thousands of women&#39;s magazine columnists. If it wasn&#39;t clear before that we technically still have English overlords, now it is.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150328/TWO.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 390px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Crowds were as excited to see Mel from Channel Seven.</i></p>
<p>
	In Australia, past visits from the Royal Family have generally been a big deal, with the streets completely blocked with people dressed in hats and gloves waving flowers and flags. The visit of Kate and Will was slightly more subdued. In fact, it was kind of embarrassing. Of the couple of hundred people who were waiting to welcome the royals, about half were foreign tourists and of those, about half had no idea there was something going on and were just there to see the Opera House.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150336/display-1.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 390px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>A small group of republican protesters were on hand to say bad things about the British.</i></p>
<p>
	The Queen doesn&#39;t have a practical impact on the lives of Australians&mdash;she&#39;s never vetoed a government decision, and likely never will (we don&#39;t know if her successors will go mad with power, but they probably won&#39;t). We don&#39;t pay any money to the Royal Family like taxpayers in the UK do, we just pay for a governor-general who has a nice house and clothing and butlers; it probably would cost the same if we replaced that office with a president. In the end, the difference between being a republic and being a monarchy is, for most of us, nothing but a symbol. The Australian Republican Movement says it&#39;s just common sense that we become a republic&mdash;why should we have a foreign head of state?&mdash;but the public at large seems to actually prefer to have someone with a crown thousands of miles away running things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Thai tourists.</i></p>
<p>
	In both Sydney and Melbourne, around a <a href="http://blog.id.com.au/2012/australian-census-2011/2011-census-multicultural-communities/" target="_blank">quarter of all people</a> are from non-English-speaking backgrounds. In some parts of these cities, more than half of residents are from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Overall, the proportion of Australians with a family connection to the UK continues to drop. Yet according to a recent <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/republican-movement-wanes-amid-royal-revival-20140415-zqv05.html" target="_blank">poll</a>,&nbsp;more than half of Australians support the monarchy, with only 42 percent favoring a republic, the lowest number in 35 years. The age group with the highest proportion of monarchists&mdash;60 percent&mdash;was 18- to 24-year-olds. That might be attributed to the kids not really thinking about the monarchy as something that can affect their lives&mdash;the last time the monarchy mattered was in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1975_Australian_constitutional_crisis" target="_blank">1975</a>, when the governor-general sacked our elected prime minister.</p>

	<i>Lisa and Kia from Quakers Hill.</i></p>
<p>
	When I talked about this stuff with Lisa and Kia, a pair of sisters from Quakers Hill, Sydney, they weren&#39;t sure what a republic was, but they were pretty happy with keeping things the way they are.</p>
<p>
	&quot;We just came to see the royals because it&#39;s free and we were bored,&rdquo; Lisa said.</p>
<p>
	Vince from the Northern Beaches was critical of the idea of a monarchy. &ldquo;They&#39;re basically just born into it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They don&#39;t have any real-life experience. They&#39;ve got it easy.&rdquo; He was there because his mom was a fan of Charles and Princess Di, and even has a plate with Diana&#39;s face on it, but he seemed not to mind the pomp and circumstance. &ldquo;It&#39;s fun,&rdquo; Vince said. &ldquo;It keeps generations going, knowing the royals.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Gabrielle Hendry and David Taylor from the Young Monarchists.</i></p>
<p>
	Other young people I met were more thoughtful in their approach. Gabrielle Hendry and David Taylor are from the Youth Monarchist movement (as well as the Young Liberals), and were handing out Australian flags. &ldquo;It&#39;s about stability,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;The Republicans haven&#39;t outlined the sort of republic they want to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Gabrielle said the royals were about more than their names. &ldquo;Kate and William have been brilliant, they&#39;re role models for all young people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Sure Kate&#39;s a princess but even if she wasn&#39;t, she&#39;s a strong, kind, beautiful woman&mdash;you don&#39;t need a title to set an example for others.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Hanging with a Meth Dealer in Vancouver, Canada</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/hanging-with-a-vancouver-meth-dealer</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 16:45:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	Vancouver&rsquo;s Downtown Eastside neighborhood, one of the poorest areas in all of Canada, is notorious for its homeless population, many of whom are mentally ill, addicted to hard drugs, or both. It&#39;s a bleak place that I associate especially with the suffering of women, perhaps because of <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/lincoln-clarkes-series-about-addicted-vancouver-women-is-still-amazing" target="_blank">Lincoln Clarkes&rsquo;s devastatingly beautiful photo series, <em>Heroines</em></a>, which documented the lives of the area&#39;s female heroin addicts. So when I learned that photographer Matthew Desouza spent some time documenting the daily affairs of Diablo, a 32-year-old meth addict and dealer, I was eager to see the neighborhood from a man&rsquo;s perspective. I called up Matt to talk about cigarettes as currency, the wildness of the McDonald&rsquo;s on East Hastings Street, and the vivid photographs he shot while hanging out with Diablo and his pals.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: How did your friendship with Diablo start?</strong><br />
	<strong>Matt Desouza</strong>: I was hanging out in the Hastings area, trying to figure out how I could get involved in a story down there. I stopped by this McDonald&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s on the outside corner of the area. I was sitting there minding my own business, and in walks Diablo. He pointed to the chair across from me that was empty and he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Hey, do you mind if I sit there?&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Buddy, I&rsquo;m going to be done in like three minutes.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; and he sits down anyway. One of the first things he said to me is, &ldquo;Do you need any jib?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;Jib, what the hell&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Crystal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I said, &ldquo;No, bro. That&rsquo;s not for me.&rdquo; And then he asked me if I wanted to see [the crystal meth]. I&rsquo;m sitting there, so I said, &ldquo;Sure, I guess,&rdquo; and he pulls it out. That was one of the first photographs I took.</p>
<p>
	He went on about how he&rsquo;s a dealer in the area, he buys and he sells, and I asked him what he was doing for the rest of the day. He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m waiting here for my buddy, I&rsquo;m buying some, I&rsquo;m selling some; I got a couple errands to run.&rdquo; So I said, &ldquo;Yo, do you mind if I follow you around and take pictures of you?&rdquo; And he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>So, Diablo and his pals were cool with you photographing them?</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t want to say Diablo was showing off, but he was totally down with it. Everywhere I&rsquo;d go with him, he&rsquo;d introduce me. He&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;This is my buddy Matt, he&rsquo;s a photographer, he&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo; One kid smoking a cigarette thought I was an undercover cop, and Diablo&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s cool, he&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This girl came into McDonald&rsquo;s, and Diablo&rsquo;s two buddies were in the background. I think she was asking if she could get some crystal off him. For one reason or another, he didn&rsquo;t sell it to her, but he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, here, you can have a cigarette.&rdquo; The photograph is of him passing her a cigarette. He called her by her first name so I&rsquo;m assuming he knew her.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/149913/matt5.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 428px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<strong>How much time did you spend with Diablo?</strong><br />
	The first day, I think I spent four or five hours hanging out with him. I&rsquo;ve gone back three or four times now. The McDonald&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s a 24-hour McDonald&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s his home. So, while we were hanging out, I took his portrait up against the wall. He had just traded a cigarette for an extra pair of glasses, the ones hanging around his neck from the big chain he has going on [<em>laughs</em>].</p>
<p>
	Cigarettes are currency down there. People would come up to him and ask for a cigarette and he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;I want your sweater.&rdquo; One cigarette gets you a sweater.</p>
<p>
	On the Hastings strip there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/inside-vancouvers-downtown-east-side-junk-market" target="_blank">a whole bunch of people who set up and sell random junk</a>. Later on, Diablo took the bag, laid out all the T-shirts, all the clothes, all the shoes, and he started selling everything. So for two cigarettes he got that whole bag of shit he was selling.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Were people paying him in cigarettes or money?</strong><br />
	Quarters, a T-shirt&mdash;basically anything.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What do you know about the McDonald&rsquo;s where Diablo spends his time?</strong><br />
	Diablo&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;This is my McDonald&rsquo;s, I run it.&rdquo; He hangs out there, he sells there, he buys there, he does his drugs there. Him and his boys are doing drugs inside, right around the corner. The employees come out to clean tables, and they don&rsquo;t even bat an eyelash. It was pretty wild in there, I gotta say.</p>
<p>
	Whenever he&rsquo;s selling, he tells people to meet him there. If I need to find him, I go right down to that McDonald&rsquo;s and nine out of ten times he&rsquo;s there. I saw him sell his crystal in there a handful of times. Sometimes he sleeps there. He showers in the sink in the washroom.</p>
<p>
	When I was in there, there were a couple of addicts hanging out in there. One guy smoked a full cigarette, threw it on the ground, and then stepped on it. I was like, &ldquo;Oh my God, we&rsquo;re going to get in trouble here,&rdquo; but no. No one came around. There were people eating McDonald&rsquo;s meals a couple spots over. No one said anything. They run the McDonald&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is the McDonald&rsquo;s where Diablo lives?</strong><br />
	He doesn&rsquo;t have another home. The photograph of stairs, that&rsquo;s from what he calls blood alley. That&rsquo;s his home. He calls it blood alley because it used to be an alleyway with a whole bunch of butcher shops in it and all the blood would run into the alley. That&rsquo;s his spot, right underneath the set of stairs. You see the two cracks in the cement? He usually gets cardboard and puts it down, and that&rsquo;s his house.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/149914/matt13.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 428px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<strong>What did you learn about Diablo by hanging with him?</strong><br />
	Aside from his addiction, he&rsquo;s actually a pretty smart dude. He&rsquo;s fluent in French and Spanish and he&rsquo;s from Montreal. If he wasn&rsquo;t an addict he&rsquo;d be a solid guy. He started speaking fluent Spanish and French for me.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Did he talk to you about how he got started with meth?</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t think I really touched on how he got into the drugs. He just said he wanted a change of scene from Montreal so he hopped on a bus and came out to Vancouver. I think he&rsquo;s been here for a few months, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s been a full year yet.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What does he think about East Hastings so far?</strong><br />
	He loves it. Something he said to me was, &ldquo;Most people that come down here, they think this is a garbage area. To me, this is home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are you taking away from your time with Diablo and his pals?</strong><br />
	As messed up as some of these addicts are, they&rsquo;re genuine people. It&rsquo;s a shame that they&rsquo;re addicts, but at the same time they&rsquo;re nice, they&rsquo;re friendly, they&rsquo;ll talk to you. They&rsquo;re sometimes coherent. Diablo took me in, he allowed me to photograph him, it&rsquo;s shit you don&rsquo;t see every day. I live by the beach in Vancouver, where everything is nice. On East Hastings, it&rsquo;s like Skid Row.</p>

<title>Former Comcast and Verizon Attorneys Now Manage the FCC and Are About to Kill the Internet</title>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>A tombstone for Internet freedom. Photo via Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/donkeyhotey/" target="_blank">DonkeyHotey</a></i></p>
<p>
	The open Internet may soon become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>
	Earlier this week, the&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;dropped something of a bombshell with&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304518704579519963416350296" target="_blank">leaked news</a>&nbsp;that the Federal Communications Commission is planning to abandon so-called &ldquo;net neutrality&rdquo; regulations&mdash;rules to ensure that Internet providers are prevented from discriminating based on content. Under the new proposed system, companies such as Comcast or Verizon will be able to create a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/opinion/creating-a-two-speed-internet.html?hpw&amp;rref=opinion" target="_blank">tiered Internet</a>, in which websites will have to pay more money for faster speeds, a change that observers predict will curb free speech, stifle innovation and increase costs for consumers.</p>
<div>
	<div>
		<p>
			Like so many problems in American government, the policy shift may relate to the pernicious corruption of the revolving door. The FCC is stocked with staffers who have recently worked for Internet Service Providers (ISP) that stand to benefit tremendously from the defeat of net neutrality.</p>
		<p>
			The backgrounds of the new FCC staff have not been reported until now.</p>
		<p>
			Take Daniel Alvarez, an attorney who has long represented Comcast through the law firm Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP. In 2010, Alvarez&nbsp;<a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view;jsessionid=1DWpTl2GX76XRpXRYQRkgwnFRMQ1vF1X1fpx2prYnyGj7b0nGypV!1281169505!1675925370?id=7020437448" target="_blank">wrote a letter</a>&nbsp;to the FCC on behalf of Comcast protesting net neutrality rules, arguing that regulators failed to appreciate &ldquo;socially beneficial discrimination.&rdquo; The proposed rules, Alvarez wrote in the letter co-authored with a top Comcast lobbyist named Joe Waz, should be reconsidered.</p>
		<p>
			Today, someone in Comcast&rsquo;s Philadelphia headquarters is probably smiling. Alvarez is now on the other side, working among a small group of legal advisors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-announces-staff-appointments" target="_blank">hired</a>&nbsp;directly under Tom Wheeler, the new FCC Commissioner who began his job in November.</p>
		<p>
			As soon as Wheeler came into office, he also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-announces-staff-appointments" target="_blank">announced the hiring</a>&nbsp;of former Ambassador Philip Verveer as his senior counselor. A records request&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/net-neutrality_astroturf_n_3894400.html" target="_blank">reveals</a>&nbsp;that Verveer also worked for Comcast in the last year. In addition, he was retained by two industry groups that have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/09/net-neutrality_astroturf_n_3894400.html" target="_blank">worked to block</a>&nbsp;net neutrality, the Wireless Association (CTIA) and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association.</p>
		<p>
			In February, Matthew DelNero was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fcc.gov/document/matthew-delnero-named-deputy-chief-wireline-competition-bureau" target="_blank">brought into</a>&nbsp;the agency to work&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hbuskirk/status/438775999665569793" target="_blank">specifically</a>&nbsp;on net neutrality. DelNero has previously&nbsp;<a href="https://prodnet.www.neca.org/wawatch/wwpdf/94ntca.pdf" target="_blank">worked as an attorney for</a>&nbsp;TDS Telecom, an Internet service provider that has&nbsp;<a href="http://soprweb.senate.gov/index.cfm?event=getFilingDetails&amp;filingID=5A327F94-607E-46C9-9E90-A46E67A89CBA&amp;filingTypeID=78" target="_blank">lobbied</a>&nbsp;on net neutrality, according to filings.</p>
		<p>
			Around the time of Delnero&rsquo;s hiring, FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, a former associate general counsel at Verizon, announced a new advisor by the name of Brendan Carr. Pai, a Republican, has criticized the open Internet regulations,&nbsp;<a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/fcc-divided-on-net-neutrality-enforcement/" target="_blank">calling them</a>&nbsp;a &ldquo;problem in search of a solution.&rdquo; It should be of little surprise that Carr, Pai&rsquo;s new legal hand, has worked for years as an attorney to AT&amp;T, CenturyLink, Verizon, and the U.S. Telecom Association, a trade group that has waged war in Washington against net neutrality&nbsp;<a href="http://news.cnet.com/Net-neutrality-proposal-revived-in-Senate/2100-1028_3-6148751.html" target="_blank">since</a>&nbsp;2006. A trail of&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110205105723/http://www.ustelecom.org/Webinars/Understanding-FCCs-New-Open-Internet-Rules.html" target="_blank">online documents</a>&nbsp;show that Carr worked specifically to monitor net neutrality regulations on behalf of some of his industry clients.</p>
		<p>
			Many have expressed shock that the Obama administration would&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/04/the-end-of-net-neutrality.html?utm_source=www&amp;utm_medium=tw&amp;utm_campaign=20140424" target="_blank">walk back</a>&nbsp;one of its biggest promises. On the campaign trail, Barack Obama said that he is a strong supporter of net neutrality. During a question and answer forum in Iowa, Obama explained, &ldquo;What you&rsquo;ve been seeing is some lobbying that says that the servers and the various portals through which you&rsquo;re getting information over the Internet should be able to be gatekeepers and to charge different rates to different Web sites &hellip; And that I think destroys one of the best things about the Internet&mdash;which is that there is this incredible equality there.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			In his first term, Obama&rsquo;s administration proposed net neutrality rules, but in January of this year, a federal court tossed the regulations in a case&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-14/verizon-wins-net-neutrality-court-ruling-against-fcc.html" target="_blank">brought by Verizon</a>. The decision left open the possibility of new rules, but only if the FCC were to reclassify the Internet as a utility. The&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;story with details about the FCC&rsquo;s leaked plans claims the agency will not be reclassifying the web as a utility. The revised rules to be announced by the FCC will allow ISPs to &ldquo;give preferential treatment to traffic from some content providers, as long as such arrangements are available on &lsquo;commercially reasonable&rsquo; terms,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304518704579519963416350296" target="_blank">reports</a>&nbsp;journalist Gautham Nagesh.</p>
		<p>
			Critics have been quick to highlight the fact that chairman Wheeler, the new head of the FCC, is a former lobbyist with close ties to the telecommunications industry. In March, telecom companies&mdash;including Comcast, Verizon, and the US Telecom Association&mdash;filled the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/220233947/FCC-welcoming-party-for-Wheeler" target="_blank">sponsor list</a>&nbsp;for a reception to toast Wheeler and other commissioners. Many of these companies have been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/lobbying-efforts-intensify-after-fcc-tries-3rd-time-on-net-neutrality.html?hpw&amp;rref=politics" target="_blank">furiously</a>&nbsp;lobbying Wheeler and other FCC officials on the expected rule since the&nbsp;Verizon&nbsp;ruling.</p>
		<p>
			Notably, though the FCC staff tilts heavily in the direction of telecoms,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2013/11/04/359006-fcc-chairman-tom-wheeler-announces-new-staffers.htm" target="_blank">Gigi Sohn</a>, Wheeler&rsquo;s advisor on external affairs, is the former CEO of Public Knowledge, an advocacy group that supports net neutrality.</p>
		<p>
			But overall, the FCC is one of many agencies that have fallen victim to regulatory capture. Beyond campaign contributions and other more visible aspects of the influence trade in Washington, moneyed special interest groups control the regulatory process by placing their representatives into public office, while dangling lucrative salaries to those in office who are considering retirement.&nbsp;The incentives, with pay often rising to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/178460/shadow-lobbying-complex" target="_blank">seven and eight figure</a>&nbsp;salaries&nbsp;on K Street, are enough to give large corporations effective control over the rule-making process.</p>
		<p>
			Of course, ISPs have many tools for shaping policy at their disposal. Giving cash to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.republicreport.org/2014/comcast-latino-merger/" target="_blank">third party groups</a>&nbsp;is another avenue for influence. Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-funded non-profit political shop, aired deceptive advertisements&nbsp;<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/06/02/233333/ralph-reed-cable-industry-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">claiming</a>&nbsp;that net neutrality is somehow a plot by bureaucrats &ldquo;to takeover the Internet.&rdquo; Asian American civil rights group OCA was one of several nonprofits caught accepting telecom money while&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/175606/interns-civil-rights-org-say-they-were-fired-disrespecting-walmart" target="_blank">penning a letter</a>&nbsp;to the FCC in opposition to net neutrality.</p>
		<p>
			The&nbsp;<a href="http://www.republicreport.org/2014/comcast-antitrust-revolvingdoor/" target="_blank">revolving door</a>, however, provides a clear and semi-legal way for businesses to directly give unlimited cash and gifts to officials who act in their favor. One of the most famous examples of this dynamic is the case of Meredith Attwell Baker, an FCC Commissioner who left her job right after voting in favor of the Comcast merger with NBC. Her next career move? She became a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/04/23/wireless-lobby-group-names-former-fcc-member-baker-as-president/" target="_blank">high-level lobbyist</a>&nbsp;for Comcast, the company she had just blessed. Earlier this week, she announced her next gig, as president of CTIA, the primary wireless industry trade group. She&rsquo;ll have her work cut out for her in lobbying her former colleagues. CTIA has&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.ctia.org/2014/01/14/ctia-net-neutrality/" target="_blank">already warned</a>&nbsp;the FCC from taking up any new net neutrality regulations.</p>

<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 15:36:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<em>It&#39;s time, once again, to marvel at some idiots who don&#39;t know how to handle the world:</em></p>
<p>
	<u><strong>Cry-Baby #1: A mystery <em>Call of Duty</em> player.&nbsp;</strong></u></p>
<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D7FQWIo2Ps8" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	<strong>The incident: </strong>Someone lost a game of <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The appropriate response: </strong>Shouting obscenities into your headset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The actual response: </strong>They allegedly called 911 and had a SWAT team sent to the other player&#39;s home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	On Tuesday, an unnamed teen in Long Beach, New York, was playing an online multiplayer game of <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>
<p>
	According to <a href="http://nydn.us/1lD11Hp" target="_blank">reports</a>, the teen won the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This apparently didn&#39;t go down so well with one of the other players. Police in Long Beach received a call around 3 PM from a man who <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/24/call-of-duty-player-fakes-murder-report-calls-swat-on-opponent" target="_blank">reportedly</a> told them, &quot;I just killed my mother, and I might shoot more people.&quot; He gave them the address of the teen who&#39;d just won at <em>Call of Duty</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The police sent multiple vehicles, an ambulance, a SWAT team, and hostage negotiators to the house.</p>
<p>
	When they arrived and entered the home, they found an unharmed family and a dude playing <em>Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>
	&quot;Everybody was scared to death,&quot; said a neighbor who witnessed the raid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Police are attempting to track down the person responsible for the 911 call, who they say probably got the teen&#39;s address after tracing his IP. If caught, they face &quot;serious charges&quot; and may have to pay back the cost of the police operation, which was probably a lot.</p>
<p>
	The teen&#39;s mother says he is &quot;not allowed to play that game ever again.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<u><strong>Cry-Baby #2: VA Medical Center</strong></u></p>
<p>
	<u><strong><img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150688/cry-baby-soda-refill-fine.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 352px;" /></strong></u></p>
<p>
	<strong>The incident:</strong> A man failed to pay for his soda refill.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The appropriate response</strong>: Asking him to pay.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The actual response</strong>: He was fined $525 and lost his job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Earlier this week, Christopher Lewis was working his construction job at VA Medical Center in North Charleston, South Carolina.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	While eating lunch in the center&#39;s on-site cafeteria, he refilled his soda cup at the soda machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to Christopher, after he did this, a man who identified himself as the chief of police approached him and asked if he was going to pay for his refill. &quot;I told him I wasn&#39;t aware that I had to pay for that,&quot; Christopher told <a href="http://www.wistv.com/story/25269079/man-hit-with-525-federal-fine-after-he-doesnt-pay-for-soda-refill" target="_blank">WISTV</a>.</p>
<p>
	He claims that he tried to pay the 89 cents on the spot, but was not allowed to. Instead, Christopher says, he was taken to a back room where he was given a $525 citation for shoplifting. He was also told he was not allowed to return to the property.</p>
<p>
	As he works on the property, this meant he was out of a job.</p>
<p>
	&quot;I&#39;m done there, at the VA hospital. I&#39;m not allowed to go on the premises anymore. I asked him can I still work on the job site and just bring my lunch and not go to the cafeteria and he said he wanted me off the premises,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>
	Christopher says that he never noticed the signs, and had always refilled his soda without paying in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&quot;Every time I look at the ticket, it&#39;s unbelievable to me,&quot; Chris said. &quot;I can&#39;t fathom the fact that I made an 89 cent mistake that cost me $525.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In a statement about the incident, the hospital said:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<em>&quot;Today a Federal citation was issued for shoplifting in the VA cafeteria to an individual who stated to VA police he had not paid for refills of beverages on multiple occasions, even though signs are posted in the cafeteria informing patrons refills are not free. Shoplifting is a crime. The dollar amount of the ticket is not determined by VA as it is a Federal citation. The citation may be paid or the recipient may choose to appear in Federal court to contest it.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	A hospital spokesperson also referred to the free refill as &quot;Theft of government property.&quot;</p>
<p>
	After local news reported on the story, the charge was downgraded from a citation to just a warning. It&#39;s unclear if Christopher has been allowed to return to his job.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Why Are Aboriginal People Who Use Toronto&#039;s Community Clinics Dying So Young?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/why-are-native-people-who-use-community-clinics-in-toronto-dying-by-age-37</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 15:27:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150491/www-toronto-ca-legdocs-mmis-2014-ex-bgrd-backgroundfile-68391-pdf.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 434px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Screenshot <a href="http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2014/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-68391.pdf" target="_blank">via</a>.</span></em><br />
	Indigenous people who use community clinics in Toronto have an average age of death of 37.</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s right. Toronto&mdash;home of pricey condos, Rob Ford, and organic pet food&mdash;is also home to a group of citizens who regularly die by 37 years of age. To put that into perspective, the average age of death for all Torontonians is 75. Thirty-seven is closer to the average age of death for a failed state like Yemen (35) or the former host of an American drone base, Djibouti (38).</p>
<p>
	This depressing finding comes from a new report published by two physicians and a clinical psychologist entitled: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2014/ex/bgrd/backgroundfile-68391.pdf" target="_blank">Early Deaths Among Members of Toronto&rsquo;s Aboriginal Community</a>.&rdquo; Dr. Chandrakant Shah, Dr. Rajbir Klair, and Dr. Allison Reeves studied the ages of death for 109 urban indigenous people who accessed four GTA health and social service centers. They also investigated the earlier life experiences of 20 of the deceased. What they heard led them to conclude there is a common root cause behind many of the early deaths.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It started with colonization&mdash;particularly <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-wildly-depressing-history-of-canadian-residential-schools" target="_blank">Residential Schools</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Act" target="_blank">Indian Act</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixties_Scoop" target="_blank">60s Scoop</a>,&rdquo; says lead investigator Dr. Shah. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the real root cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Dr. Shah has thought a lot about colonization. Since coming to Canada from India in 1965, he has devoted much of his career to working with indigenous peoples. Reflecting on his birth country&rsquo;s history, he conceded that many in his generation saw the British as superior. &ldquo;We still had a colonized mind,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But my children... Their minds are free. They think they can do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Witnessing that transformation might be why today you can find an <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/what-exactly-is-idle-no-more" target="_blank">&ldquo;Idle No More&rdquo;</a> poster on the door to his office at Anishnawbe Health Toronto. AHT, located in a brick building at Queen and Sherbourne, is one of the four GTA sites in the report. It is funded by the Province of Ontario.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Shah describes the mechanism by which colonial policies result in early deaths as a &ldquo;delayed Tsunami effect. The effects are slow, but big,&rdquo; he told me. Residential schools and other similarly damaging policies cause trauma in individuals, which often leads to lives marred by high-risk behaviors like violence and substance abuse. Those high-risk behaviors in turn lead to early deaths.</p>
<p>
	At 51, Doll Pangowish has outlived many of those in the study, but the &ldquo;delayed Tsunami&rdquo; struck her all the same. After 25 years in Toronto, she knows what it is like to be poor, urban-dwelling, and indigenous. &ldquo;Homelessness became a part of our life because I was drinking,&rdquo; she says, acknowledging her youngest son, now 17. Pangowish avoided the streets by couch surfing. She adds: &ldquo;The amount of money we had, we couldn&rsquo;t afford a proper home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	That lifestyle eventually caught up with Pangowish. A diabetic, the drinking complicated her condition, leading to nerve damage in her legs and ulcers on her feet. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t apply pressure on my foot,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;There was always pain, there was bleeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Today Pangowish speaks bluntly about her experience: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not ashamed to talk about it any more.&rdquo; When asked what led her to such a self-destructive lifestyle, she refers back to her childhood on the Wikwemikong Unceded Indian Reserve on Manitoulin Island. &ldquo;We were very dysfunctional,&rdquo; she told me. Many in her mother&#39;s family went to Residential Schools. &ldquo;That played a great big role,&rdquo; Pangowish says. &ldquo;And my father was abusive, physically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Anyone with a sense and knowledge of Aboriginal lives would see that their circumstances contribute to their outcomes,&rdquo; explains Dr. Evan Adams, a Coast Salish Medical Doctor and Deputy Provincial Health Officer for British Columbia (you may also recognize him as &ldquo;Thomas Builds-The-Fire&rdquo; from the classic Native American film <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPyiebzmteg" target="_blank">Smoke Signals</a></em>).</p>
<p>
	Turning to the &ldquo;Early Deaths,&rdquo; report, however, Dr. Adams urges caution. &ldquo;This is a disturbing, but tiny set of data,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re describing an at-risk urban Aboriginal population, not the entire urban Aboriginal population.&rdquo; To understand his perspective, compare the 109 deaths Dr. Shah and colleagues examined to the overall Toronto indigenous population of 37,000.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Adams is familiar with the challenges of many urban poor, having worked in Vancouver&rsquo;s Downtown Eastside for five years. Still, he is concerned that focusing only on the most vulnerable indigenous people in Canada&rsquo;s cities will obscure the reality that many other First Nations, M&eacute;tis, and Inuit are thriving. It is of course very hard to forget the urban indigenous success stories when you are speaking to an Actor/Physician with a Master&rsquo;s in Public Health degree like Dr. Adams.</p>
<p>
	He says this study helps underscore the need for better data on the health of urban indigenous people. &ldquo;We know more about First Nations people on-reserve, who are the minority, than we do about urban First Nations people.&rdquo; He is right about First Nations people on-reserve being the minority. Some 55 percent of First Nations people lived off-reserve in 2011, according to Statistics Canada. The off-reserve figure is closer to 75 percent if you include all Aboriginal people (First Nations, M&eacute;tis, and Inuit).</p>
<p>
	Better data, including an analysis of the causes (and not just ages) of death, would help provide better solutions, according to Dr. Adams.</p>
<p>
	So how does Canada fix the problem of early deaths among vulnerable urban indigenous people?</p>
<p>
	Pangowish found a way to solve her most pressing personal issues when she went to treatment. It helped her change her life for the better, and led to a renewed focus on her health. She improved her diet and her ulcers are gone, at least for now. Her teenaged son was a big help too, becoming a live-in caregiver while she was bedridden. &ldquo;He was my legs,&rdquo; Pangowish remembers. She would like to see more urban, indigenous-based, support and health services. &ldquo;People need somebody they can trust. I had to go to another community to understand what I was doing to my body and my children,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We need that in our own community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	For Dr. Shah, he hopes reports like his will motivate mainstream Canadians to educate themselves on indigenous issues. &ldquo;If you have no knowledge of the impact of Residential Schools or the 60s scoop, you don&rsquo;t have empathy,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have empathy, you don&rsquo;t have good policies and programs.&rdquo; Dr. Shah also believes reconnecting with indigenous culture is key to healthier outcomes for indigenous people.</p>
<p>
	Dr. Adams goes further, arguing that medical practices need to change too. One of his recommendations is that a patient&rsquo;s history with Residential Schools should be included in their charts. &ldquo;It can be important,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need to make room for clinicians like Dr. Shah to look at those social determinants of health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Pointing to similar rates of health care spending in Canada and the US, Dr. Adams argues that having a more egalitarian health system does not necessarily mean a more expensive one.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;You can let people die in the streets, but it will cost about the same,&rdquo; Dr. Adams concludes. &ldquo;Or you can do what&rsquo;s morally right.&rdquo;<br />

<title>Canada Bought $50 Million Worth of &#039;Secure&#039; Phone Systems from the NSA</title>

	World leaders may be fretting over whether the NSA bugged their phones, but Canadian government officials aren&#39;t particularly worried&mdash;they bought theirs directly from the agency.&nbsp;A survey of&nbsp;<a href="https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/search/site/%2522national%2520security%2520agency%2522" target="_blank">procurement records</a>&nbsp;kept on public government websites reveals that Canada has spent over $50 million purchasing&nbsp;a bevy of secure communications equipment from&nbsp;the largest branch of the American intelligence community. &nbsp;</p>

<title>&#039;I Played for Gaddafi&#039;s Basketball Team at the Start of the Libyan Revolution&#039;</title>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Alex (center, in the black T-shirt) with some of his Libyan teammates. All photos courtesy of Alex Owumi</em></p>
<p>
	There are a few things to expect when you start playing basketball at an international level: a gruelling training regime, competitive teammates, and maybe some kind of sponsorship deal involving toiletries or luminous drinks. Stuff you generally don&rsquo;t prepare yourself for, however, is almost starving to death while the army shoots at civilians just outside your apartment, being forced to survive on cockroaches and toilet water and fleeing a country by way of a border occupied by rebel guards. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s what happened to Alex Owumi, an American ball player who moved to Benghazi, Libya after being recruited by Al-Nasr, a team owned by the Gaddafi family. Alex arrived at the end of 2010 and enjoyed a few months as the team&rsquo;s point guard, before the revolution broke out in February of 2011 and he found himself trapped in his apartment&mdash;a lavish place owned by Gaddafi&rsquo;s son, Mutassim&mdash;without any food or electricity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	With little contact to the outside world, he survived by eating worms and drinking toilet water &ndash; his teeth turning rotten and the pigment on his face discolouring&mdash;until he got a call from his former coach, who smuggled him over the border to Egypt. After arriving in Alexandria, he recovered and started playing for the city&rsquo;s El Olympi, helping them win 13 games in a row and eventually take the championship. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I gave him a call to talk about his experience, the Gaddafi family and how the revolution changed his outlook on life.</p>

	<em>Alex in Libya</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: So, that&#39;s quite an experience you went through. Can you tell me how you ended up in Libya?</strong><br />
	<strong>Alex Owumi:</strong> It was a pretty bad time for me as a player, then my manager phoned me up and told me there was this team in Libya that wanted me to play for them. At that point it was either doing this for me or going back home. And I was welcomed there with open arms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Did you know at that point that it was Gaddafi&#39;s team you were going to play for?</strong><br />
	I didn&rsquo;t find out it was Gaddafi&rsquo;s team until I first got into my apartment. It was all beautiful and state of the art, but I noticed there were also quite a lot of pictures of Gaddafi and his grandkids. That&rsquo;s when I finally asked my team captain whose apartment this was, and he told me it belonged to the Gaddafi family.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Did that scare you?</strong><br />
	I wasn&rsquo;t really scared. I grew up in Nigeria before my family moved to America, and we all sort of looked up to him there. Also, at that point I hadn&rsquo;t really heard about all the bad stuff he was doing&mdash;probably because I was too busy playing sports.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Right. So what happened next? How was playing for Al-Nasr?</strong><br />
	The training wasn&rsquo;t really that unusual, but when I got there they had lost a few times in a row and some of the players weren&rsquo;t getting paid or were being physically abused by the guards. There were always armed security guards around. I remember, when I was a kid, playing basketball and just having fun&mdash;even when I went to high school and started playing professionally. But that&rsquo;s kind of hard when you have a guy with an AK-47 standing in the corner during training. And when you play a game you just can&rsquo;t lose.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Was your life controlled outside of training at all?</strong><br />
	No, I could basically go anywhere I wanted. At that time the city was still very pro-Gaddafi, so when I went to the market to buy food or went to a restaurant I never had to pay for anything. It was all provided for. And I had a driver, too. There was just nowhere to go, really; Benghazi isn&rsquo;t a very exciting city.</p>
<p>

	<em>The view from Alex&#39;s apartment in Benghazi after the revolution had broken out</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>Had you anticipated the violence at the beginning of the revolution at all? Where were you when everything started kicking off?</strong><br />
	There had been protests going on for a few days. I was on my roof, looking over the city and the main square, where there were about 300 people protesting. I was supposed to meet my coach, Sharif, later on. I went downstairs to get a bottle of water and then went up again to see how things were going. Suddenly the military arrived and started shooting into the crowd, and that was the beginning of it all. I ran back downstairs into my apartment and tried to call my teammate, Moustafa, but the phone was dead&mdash;everything just stopped. I was trying to call my parents in the US, but nothing was working.</p>
<p>
	<strong>And what happened next?</strong><br />
	My apartment was basically in the middle of the fighting zone and I couldn&rsquo;t get out. The food I had lasted about two days, and I had no electricity, no running water&mdash;nothing. I eventually started drinking out of the toilet, and when the hunger pains got really bad I started eating cockroaches and worms that I picked out of the flowerpots. The shooting and fighting in the streets continued all the time.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did you eventually get out of there?</strong><br />
	I still had my mobile phone, but I had it off most of the time to save the battery. One day, after almost two weeks, I heard this strange noise and suddenly realized it was the phone ringing. It was Moustafa; he was asking me how I was, and I think he could hear the pain in my voice. He told me he had found a way for us to get out, but I was just like, &quot;We&rsquo;re never gonna get out of here.&quot; The important thing for him was just to get home and get to his family, but he didn&rsquo;t know that I hadn&rsquo;t eaten at all or that I had witnessed certain things, so he thought it would be easy. He told me to meet up with him the next day at the coach&#39;s office.</p>
<p>
	<strong>I&#39;m assuming it wasn&#39;t too easy to get over there.</strong><br />
	I was really struggling to make it downstairs as I was so weak already, but I met a group of kids outside the building who I used to play football with. They were now carrying guns themselves and they helped me navigate my way through the city. At the office, our team president, Mr Ahmed, had organized a car to bring me and Moustafa to the Egyptian border, a six-hour drive. It took us 12 hours in the end, with so many rebel checkpoints to pass, but we made it eventually.</p>

	<em>Alex holding the Egyptian championship trophy</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>How come you stuck around in Egypt for a while rather than going straight home?</strong><br />
	My coach in Libya, Sharif, was Egyptian, so I first went to stay with him when we arrived, and the plan was that he would put me on a plane back home. But then he saw me, and looking the way I did and talking the way I was he kind of predicted that it would have been bad for me to go home at that point. He knew that I had people at home who loved me, but he didn&rsquo;t want my family to see me like that. It was hard enough for him to see me like that.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Then you played a season for El Olympi in Alexandria, right?</strong><br />
	Yeah. Sharif predicted that basketball would help me to rehabilitate, and it actually worked&mdash;even though people were saying, &quot;This kid is crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>The game saved you.</strong><br />
	Yeah, basically. Basketball is kind of my safe haven. My father and my uncle both fought in the civil war, so they kind of understood the things I was going through. But what happened to me in Libya really opened my eyes to what&rsquo;s going on in other parts of the world. I look at things differently now. And I&rsquo;m just trying to keep moving.</p>

<title>North Korea&#039;s Got a Big Crystal Meth Problem  </title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-crystal-meth-drugs-diplomats-nathan-thompson</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 13:40:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150641/51231301-a4177d4750-z.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Dancing girls in Pyongyang (Image via&nbsp;Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/leef_smith/51231301">Leef_Smith</a>)</span></em></p>
<p>
	North Korean meth is the bomb&mdash;at least, according to US officials who tested two batches last year. The packages of sharp, ice-like crystals measured 98 percent and 96 percent for purity, respectively. According to an indictment against the suppliers, who were <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/divisions/hq/2013/hq112013a.pdf" target="_blank">arrested in 2013</a>, the drug was so pure that &ldquo;people in New York, they went crazy&hellip; the places that we put it in the States, New York&hellip; Boston, all these places, I mean, they went crazy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to <a href="http://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/SCG-FINAL-FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">a new report</a> by Dr. Sheena Chestnut Greitens, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Missouri, the North Korean government has used drug manufacturing and a host of other nefarious activities to raise funds since the 1970s. The regime defaulted on its international loans in 1976 and Dr. Greitens describes how that same year &ldquo;a dozen members of North Korea&rsquo;s diplomatic corps, including the North Korean Ambassador to Norway, [were] ejected&hellip; for <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914629,00.html" target="_blank">smuggling illicit goods</a>&quot; including &quot;4,000 bottles of booze (mostly Polish vodka) and 140,000 cigarettes&quot; in Sweden, and &quot;400 bottles of liquor, 4.5 million cigarettes. and 147 kilos of hashish in Denmark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	After the collapse of the USSR, North Korea lost its communist financers and that, combined with tough sanctions and disastrous policy decisions, resulted in the famine of the 1990s where an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean_famine#Estimated_deaths" target="_blank">estimated</a> one million people died. Factories were not operating and fishermen starved in the harbor, as they had no oil to power their boats. Desperate to survive, the Kim regime forced community farms to cultivate opium poppies and demanded as much as 132 pounds of raw opium per harvest. &ldquo;We should be growing grain, not poppies,&rdquo; said one defector quoted in Dr. Greitens&#39; report. &ldquo;But the instruction from the central government was that if we grow poppies we can sell the product for ten times as much to buy grain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	After the famine ended in the 2000s, North Korean factories began to produce a more modern type of drug: methamphetamine. &ldquo;Officials from North Korea&rsquo;s various security agencies were reportedly involved in guarding the plants and factories,&rdquo; writes Dr. Greitens. Within the factories, real-life Walter Whites were hired to school local chemists in the art of synthesizing pure, potent meth crystals. &ldquo;Experts were brought in to advise on production.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150642/2851372906-dff57bcde5-o.jpg" style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">A line of crystal meth or &quot;bangdu&quot; in Chinese (Image via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/2851372906">Digitalcolony</a>)</span></em></p>
<p>
	North Korean meth and heroin was highly prized on the black market and Triad and Yakuza gangs were lining up to distribute the drugs across China, Japan, and the US, according to Dr. Greitens. &ldquo;The gangs would pick up packages of drugs dropped at sea... Drugs were also transported by train (and other methods) across North Korea&rsquo;s northern border into China.&quot;</p>
<p>
	But why rely on desperate gangsters when you have a host of agents stationed legally inside target nations with diplomatic immunity? Indeed, North Korean embassy staff continued to be thrown out of their host nations on various charges. As well as drugs, North Korean officials have been caught smuggling such things as <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32167.pdf" target="_blank">rhino horns and ivory</a>, 500,000 <a href="http://www.hri.org/news/greek/ana/2006/06-10-30.ana.html#15" target="_blank">counterfeit cigarettes</a> and counterfeit $100 bills so convincing that US treasury officials dubbed them <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/magazine/23counterfeit.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&amp;gwh=28FF47BA1DB7548996385C0570E0D19C&amp;gwt=regi" target="_blank">&ldquo;supernotes.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Given the variety of products involved in these incidents and the repeated presence of North Korean diplomats in them, these incidents appear to be primarily the result of a &lsquo;self-financing&rsquo; policy,&rdquo; writes Dr. Greitens, &ldquo;by which embassies are expected to finance their own operations, and contribute money back to the regime in Pyongyang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Since 2005, the regime has apparently scaled back official meth manufacture. &ldquo;The North Korean government already burned all the labs to show the Americans that they are not selling it any more [but] then they transferred it to another base,&rdquo; one of the meth importers arrested last year was quoted as saying in the indictment. Elsewhere in the document, he claims, &ldquo;only [North Koreans] can get the real North Korean product now.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The closure of government meth labs has left a lot of talented meth cooks unemployed and many continue to operate in what Dr. Greitens calls &ldquo;a hybrid space between public and private.&rdquo; In these gray markets, political elites grab a share of the profits raised from evil-smelling meth kitchens constructed in broken-down houses and abandoned school buildings.</p>
<p>
	While the regime asserts that &ldquo;North Koreans with healthy mental and moral qualities have no intention of turning out or <a href="http://www.nknews.org/2013/09/north-korean-drug-abuse-spreads/" target="_blank">exporting narcotics</a>,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s clear that no large-scale economic activity happens in North Korea without officials knowing about it&mdash;I mean, what kind of totalitarian regime would they be if they didn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150644/8651414375-2e8b3e4ca0-z.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, and some generals (Image <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmcnab/8651414375" target="_blank">via</a>)&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
	Unsurprisingly, domestic use of meth has skyrocketed. Suited elites in Pyongyang restaurants offer each other a &ldquo;nose&rdquo; after dinner, the middle classes take it as a cold cure or remedy for back pain, and the poor take it to ease the emptiness in their stomachs. The drug is apparently so common that the attitude of North Koreans has <a href="http://newfocusintl.com/drugs-north-korea-even-greetings-changed/" target="_blank">become blas&eacute;</a>.&nbsp;&ldquo;When meeting people we not infrequently swapped drugs to see whose ice was more potent,&rdquo; said one defector in Dr. Greitens&rsquo;s report. &ldquo;We just did it naturally as if we were exchanging cigarettes.&rdquo; Another defector said, &ldquo;If people in the countryside take ice, their back pain is cured... And if you give it to people who have had a stroke, they recover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	While the regime denies exporting meth, large amounts continue to leave the country. In 2011 Chinese authorities reported that they had <a href="http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2011070521408" target="_blank">seized over $60 million worth of drugs</a> coming in from the hermit kingdom. In the Chinese border province of Jilin, the number of people addicted to drugs has <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CD8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asiapundits.com%2Fchina-and-north-koreas-growing-drug-problem%2F&amp;ei=yGVaU63gI-Wd0QX1oIHYCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB3dV0g_WjD0TvdzqTh3HD0oA17Q&amp;sig2=ww_8G4fWa1w6LC4oIjk1lg&amp;bvm=bv.65397613,d.d2k" target="_blank">leapt</a> from a registered 44 in 1991 to an estimated <a href="http://sinonk.com/2012/02/07/spreading-meth-across-the-chinese-north-korean-border/" target="_blank"> 10,000 today</a>.</p>
<p>
	North Korea&#39;s involvement in the drug trade is a result of economic necessity and the ideology of self-reliance. The tragic fallout of these policies has led many of the country&#39;s own citizens to become addicted to the drugs their country is peddling abroad.</p>

<title>This Week in Racism: Avril Lavigne&#039;s New Music Video Isn&#039;t Racist, It Just Sucks</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/avril-lavignes-new-music-video-isnt-racist-it-just-sucks-twir</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2014 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Dx6NnZBv6pQ" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	<em>Welcome to another edition of This Week in Racism. I&rsquo;ll be ranking news stories on a scale of one to RACIST, with &ldquo;one&rdquo; being the least racist and &ldquo;RACIST&rdquo; being the most racist.</em></p>
<p>
	&ndash;Avril Lavigne&mdash;perhaps the most boring pop star of her generation&mdash;is back; redesigned and remixed for another run at glory. At the advanced (for the music industry) age of 29, Avril seemingly has no idea what kids are into, which led her to making a tone-deaf, idiotic music video that the media <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/avril-lavigne-kitty-video-racist/story?id=23453019" target="_blank">quickly branded as racist</a>.</p>
<p>
	When&nbsp;<em>Let Go, </em>her massively popular debut album<em>,&nbsp;</em>came out in 2002, she was 17. &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; radio was still dominated by shitty nu-metal. Teenagers into rebellion wore flared jeans with fucking buckles all over them, and pretended to know how to skateboard. If you bought a CD copy of the <em>Daredevil </em>soundtrack, wore Stone Cold Steve Austin t-shirts to church, and could name more than one member of the band Staind, you probably also liked Avril.</p>
<p>
	Under the guidance of heavyweight production duo, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(production_team)" target="_blank">The Matrix</a> (not related to the equally dated movie), <em>Let Go</em> tapped into a generation&#39;s butt rock-tinged disillusion and &quot;fuck you&quot; attitude. Mall punks finally had their moment of glory in the early 2000s. <em>Let Go</em> sold 18 million copies worldwide and also totally fucking sucks ass. Avril was of her time and has never quite escaped it, like a pixie-punk Han Solo in carbonite. Her most recent, self-titled album pretty much sounded identical to everything else she&#39;s ever done. There were a few girly pop songs, plus some fake attempts to seem sincere in the form of overwrought, mopey ballads about introspection. I don&#39;t see a lot of people expressing sincere nostalgia for the lyrical ingenuity of &quot;Sk8r Boi,&quot; and that&#39;s because her music has always been vapid.</p>
<p>
	Since she never <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/in-defense-of-the-basic-bitch" target="_blank">melted down</a> or did anything remotely interesting outside of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq3Dhacyksg" target="_blank">prouncing David Bowie&#39;s name</a> in a way Americans were not used to, Avril&#39;s stuck around the public consciousness. There&#39;s been just enough going on in her personal life to allow her to stay semi-relevant. She married&mdash;and eventually divorced&mdash;fellow Canadian wastoid&nbsp;<a href="http://perezhilton.com/2013-06-07-avril-lavinge-deryck-whibley-tom-petty-concert-new-look" target="_blank">Deryck Whibley</a> of Sum 41. She magically ditched him for someone even lamer: Nickelback lead singer Chad Kroeger. Nickelback, despite being the audio equivalent of cutting your dick off and leaping from a rooftop, is one of the biggest selling bands of all time; a modern-day equivalent of the Eagles. They&#39;re a successful group no one you know admits to liking.</p>
<p>
	Avril appeared as though she was just going to disappear from the spotlight, content to pop up on the cover of <em>People</em> every time she decided to spawn a new press release... I mean, child. Instead, she started the comeback no one asked for on Wednesday with the release of a new music video for a song titled &quot;Hello Kitty.&quot; The video, embedded above, depicts a fun, carefree Avril frolicking through Japan flanked by a gaggle of stoic Asian accessories.</p>
<p>
	In place of turgid navel-gazing, Avril&#39;s song is a would-be club banger. The song is Katy Perry without all the &quot;witty&quot; double entendres. The raccoon eyeliner that has become synonymous with her &quot;brand&quot; remains, but now she&#39;s dressing like a cartoon version of a raver in 2006. Only a person who became a multi-millionaire (and totally lost track of trends) before turning 18 could think that fetishizing Japanese culture was still cool. It&#39;s been a full decade since Gwen Stefani caught a big pile of shit for the Harajuku Girls. Eastern &quot;curiosities&quot; like omakase, Pokemon, Godzilla, and tentacle porn are pretty mainstream in America now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Maybe that&#39;s why it&#39;s so jarring to see Avril flail around in this video. It&#39;s calculated, but the formula got all screwed up. The girls in the background might as well be animatronic bears at Disneyland, but that&#39;s true of all back-up dancers. It&#39;s that she picked <em>this shit</em> to steal, after we&#39;ve already gone through an identical debate 10 years ago.</p>
<p>
	The tone-deaf insensitivity of the video is typified by the scene with Avril&mdash;sporting a retro plastic camera, which like Avril, is a cultural anachronism from the early&nbsp;2000s&mdash;taking a photo of the four unmoving, scowling Japanese dancers as though they were, themselves, a tourist attraction. I&#39;m sure she really loves Japan, but what Japan clearly represents to her is an aesthetic to commodify, just like any celebrity who engages in cultural tourism. It makes for a motif for your video. It gives the designers working on your world tour a template to follow. It&#39;s a way to brand yourself, to give people like me an excuse to talk about you.</p>
<p>
	What&#39;s sad about this isn&#39;t that Avril is making a farce of Japanese culture. Americans have been doing that for 70 years. It&#39;s sad that she totally whiffed when she picked a culture to appropriate. While Miley Cyrus, Lana Del Rey, and Sky Ferreira shoot videos with spectacularly handsome black men sporting implied criminal records, Avril is freaking out over a plate of sushi. It&#39;s the pop culture equivalent of wearing board shorts to a funeral.</p>
<p>
	Instead of getting people talking about how edgy and forward-thinking she is, Avril&#39;s going to get a few more down votes on YouTube and a couple embarrassing appearances on late-night talk shows. Not racist, but also not worth it. <strong>3</strong></p>

<p>
	&ndash;Nevada cattle &quot;baron&quot; and conservative icon Cliven Bundy, the man thumbing his nose at the rule of law by refusing to pay the government over a $1 million in federal cattle grazing fees, did his cause a major disservice by getting caught by the <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/us/politics/rancher-proudly-breaks-the-law-becoming-a-hero-in-the-west.html?ref=us&amp;_r=1&amp;utm_content=buffercfc27&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&amp;referrer=" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em></a> using racially charged language:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro,&rdquo; he said. Mr. Bundy recalled driving past a public-housing project in North Las Vegas, &ldquo;and in front of that government house the door was usually open and the older people and the kids&mdash;and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t have nothing to do. They didn&rsquo;t have nothing for their kids to do. They didn&rsquo;t have nothing for their young girls to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&ldquo;And because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I&rsquo;ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn&rsquo;t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In addition to the <em>Times</em> revelation, <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/cliven-bundy-racist-rant-video.html?mid=google" target="_blank"><em>New York</em> magazine</a> claims the above video is of Bundy spouting rhetoric identical to the aforementioned quotes. Republican Senators Rand Paul and Dean Heller, previously supporters of Bundy, have come out against his rather antiquated opinions on race relations. I guess Paul and Heller were surprised that a guy who raises cows in the middle of nowhere would advocate for black people to go back to an agrarian way of life, even if that way of life included bondage and violence. Who would have guessed that a man flagrantly defying federal law would think that government subsidy is antithetical to freedom? Maybe Rand Paul and Dean Heller <em>just never thought about it</em>. Oops.&nbsp;<strong>RACIST</strong></p>

	&ndash;Gil Voigt, a Cincinnati teacher we <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/an-interracial-couple-new-years-racism-twir" target="_blank">previously covered</a> for telling his student that &quot;we don&#39;t need another black president,&quot; has been <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/18/teacher-racism-fired/7876581/" target="_blank">officially fired</a> for his actions. He&#39;d been suspended pending review, and I guess the review came back. Voigt&nbsp;claimed he was misquoted, and <em>actually</em> said, &quot;I think we can&#39;t afford another president like Obama, whether he&#39;s black or white.&quot; One version of this incident is racist, one isn&#39;t. We&#39;ll never know the truth, yet espousing political views of any sort is probably a bad call when you&#39;re a public school teacher. He may not actually be a racist, but Ol&#39; Gil is out of a job either way. Hey Gil, you know who else is gonna be unemployed soon? Barack Obama. <strong>7</strong></p>

<title>An Interview with the Woman Who Pays Drug Addicts to Get Sterilized</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/project-prevention-compulsory-sterilization</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 14:24:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/149739/Screenshot-2014-04-21-18-00-29.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Project Prevention founder Barbara Harris. Screencap via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BWL7Pn6iME" target="_blank">YouTube user lotingwei</a></i></p>
<p>
	In 1989, Barbara Harris founded C.R.A.C.K, or Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity, the program that would eventually be rebranded as Project Prevention, although it was never technically renamed.</p>
<p>
	What they do at Project Prevention is, according to Harris, &quot;work to get drug addicts and alcoholics on long-term birth control so they don&rsquo;t conceive while using.&quot; How they get them on long-term birth control is, they pay them $300.</p>
<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RRi3apl5p_Y?rel=0" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Why does the lady give crack to her baby? What a waste of crack.</span></em></p>
<p>
	Since its inception Project Prevention has provided incentives that led to tubal ligations, contraceptive implants, and vasectomies for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.projectprevention.org/whats-new/">over 4,000</a>&nbsp;people in the US and the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	I set out to talk to Barbara about what it&#39;s like to pay people to get sterilized, but during our phone call we got into the moral complexities of Project Prevention, and what it&#39;s like to be the organization&#39;s public face. I also asked her about her brother-in-law who smokes crack.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: A question I&#39;m sure you get asked all the time is, how do you usually respond when somebody calls you a eugenicist or a Nazi?&nbsp;</strong><br />
	<strong>Barbara Harris: </strong>It doesn&rsquo;t bother me. People come to us by choice. We don&rsquo;t force anybody to do anything. And what we&rsquo;re doing is preventing suffering and damage to innocent children, so it&rsquo;s nothing compared to any of that. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me, I&rsquo;ve been called everything, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. &lsquo;Cause I know the motives behind what I&rsquo;m doing and I know what the reasons are.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>How is 2014 going for Project Prevention?</strong><br />
	Well it&rsquo;s going very well. In the very beginning when we first started the organization it was kind of taboo to work with us or talk with us, but it&rsquo;s getting to the point now where people are just fed up.</p>
<p class="p1">
	And even those who oppose what we do, they don&rsquo;t have a solution, they just want to yell: &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Just like those who stand out at the abortion clinics saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have an abortion.&rdquo; If the women try not to have an abortion, would they raise their children? Probably not.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>So, just for the record, you don&rsquo;t consider yourself to be anti-abortion in any way?</strong><br />
	I think that our organization doesn&rsquo;t take a stand on that one way or another but we&rsquo;re preventing abortions because the women that come through our program have had numerous abortions. They use abortions for birth control.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Could you tell me about how early coverage overused the word &quot;sterilization&quot;?</strong><br />
	It seemed like every time somebody wrote a story, the headline would read, &ldquo;Organization sterilizing women.&rdquo; At first it would upset us, then we decided to flip it back on the media. So if we had a press conference or something we knew that they would attend our press conference if we put in the title headline, &ldquo;Organization that sterilizes drug addicts,&rdquo; we knew they would go, &ldquo;Oh my gosh,&rdquo; and then they would show up to our press conference and then get the details.</p>
<p class="p2">
	So, that word just gets people&rsquo;s attention and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s used. But it&rsquo;s OK, because if it gets people&#39;s attention and they stay focused long enough to read the entire article, and it&rsquo;s written correctly and tells what we really do, they&rsquo;ll see that that&rsquo;s not our mission.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>There&rsquo;s this term that some people use called trolling. Have you heard of it? </strong><br />
	No.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Trolling is basically where you sort of want to stir up controversy so you use whatever language will stir up the most controversy. Is that kind of what this is?&nbsp;</strong><br />
	I guess, yeah, I would guess so because they&rsquo;re just throwing it out there. Like fishing, they&rsquo;re just throwing it out there on the end of the line. They know if they use &ldquo;birth control&rdquo; as a title they&rsquo;re not going to get the same attention that they&rsquo;ll get with the word &ldquo;sterilization,&rdquo; so they&rsquo;re definitely going to use it to their advantage.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>You used to be called C.R.A.C.K. Why did you switch over to Project Prevention?</strong><br />
	The legal name of the organization is still [C.R.A.C.K], we just use Project Prevention because it was one less thing we had to listen to that took away from the importance of what we were doing. We&rsquo;re spending so much time explaining the name of the organization, explaining things that really aren&rsquo;t important</p>
<p class="p1">
	When I came up with the name of the organization I basically just sat down and took the drug that my children were born addicted to and tried to come up with an acronym for it. It was really that simple. You know, it wasn&rsquo;t so that people would think of black women. I&rsquo;ve been accused of naming it that so people would think of black people when they hear the name. I tell people, &ldquo;You give me way too much credit,&rdquo; it definitely wasn&rsquo;t that involved. It was as simple as me coming up with words that went with the word crack.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Before you founded the organization, I heard there was an effort on your part to change the politics surrounding pregnancy and addiction in California.</strong><br />
	It was <a href="ftp://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/95-96/bill/asm/ab_2601-2650/ab_2614_bill_960325_amended_asm.html" target="_blank">Assembly Bill 2614</a>, so I don&rsquo;t know whether you can go back and find those things or not, but what happened was a senator in Ohio had contacted me and told me that he was trying to pass the bill that would have made it so that women had to use long-term birth control if they had babies. So I found somebody in California who was willing to write a bill as well, but once they got ahold of the bill they changed it and made it to something that wasn&rsquo;t what I agreed with anymore, because they wanted to make women go to jail if they didn&rsquo;t get birth control.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Have you ever heard of <a href="http://action.rhrealitycheck.org/page/s/gov-haslam-veto-pregnancy-criminalization-sb-1391" target="_blank">SB1391 in Tennessee</a>? (I&#39;m referring to a proposed Tennessee law that would impose criminal penalties on mothers of newborns who have been exposed to addictive, illegal, or prescription drugs in utero.)</strong><br />
	Somebody sent me this, just within the last month, right?</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Yeah this is new.</strong><br />
	I think I put it on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Project-Prevention/110690795614449" target="_blank">Project Prevention Facebook page</a>. I&rsquo;m pretty sure.</p>
<p class="p2">
	<strong>It kind of sounds like the California thing that you were sort of opposed to.</strong><br />
	Yeah, that&rsquo;s not a good idea. Because, like I said, the women are going to stop going to the hospital. If you know you&rsquo;re going to be arrested when you go to the hospital, are you going to show up? There&rsquo;s better ways to work it out.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Does your brother-in-law still live on Skid Row in LA?</strong><br />
	Sure does. Yes he does.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<strong>Do you happen to know how he got there?</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t know because he&rsquo;s brilliant. You know what I mean? He is brilliant. He has the potential to make an income higher than anybody you might know. He&rsquo;s that brilliant. But it seems that ever time he gets to a point in his life where he gets up that way, he just self-destructs. So I don&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s been there so long now that I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll ever come out of it, he&rsquo;ll be there the rest of his life because it&rsquo;s been probably over 20 years.</p>
<p class="p2">
	<strong>Does he use heroin? Crack?</strong><br />
	I think he&rsquo;s on crack.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>That&rsquo;s really unfortunate. I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that he still lives there.</strong><br />
	Yeah, it is sad.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Recently there&rsquo;s been this story floating around the internet about the state of California <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/california-female-prisoner-sterilization" target="_blank">sterilizing 150 female prisoners</a>.&nbsp;</strong><br />
	So they didn&rsquo;t know they were or they were misled to where they could undo it? I don&rsquo;t understand why they would have done it. Did they offer them something? Bribe them? Why did they do it?</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>I don&rsquo;t think they bribed them. I think they sort of woke up, having given birth, and now sterilized, and it had to be explained to them later. So I was just asking if you could comment on that.</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t agree with what they did, but I understand it, if that makes any sense. I don&rsquo;t agree because I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s OK to do that, but I understand the frustration behind the people who do things like that. We had one girl who came through my program who was going to get a tubal ligation and when she went she found out that it had already been done.</p>
<p class="p1">
	A doctor in LA, I don&rsquo;t know who it was, she tied her tubes without her knowing it when she delivered her fifth or sixth child. And I understand that. That&rsquo;s wrong and you can&rsquo;t do it, but I understand the frustration of these doctors. You know what I mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<strong>What did she do next?</strong><br />
	I have no idea; I just know she was mad. I don&rsquo;t know if she was mostly mad because she wasn&rsquo;t going to get money from us or, I don&rsquo;t really know. I don&rsquo;t know what happened, I didn&rsquo;t stay in touch with her, but I just know that happened. So I doubt she did anything.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p class="p2">
	<strong>What a drag! So you weren&rsquo;t able to send her a check?</strong><br />
	No, she had already been sterilized.</p>
<p class="p2">
	My thinking is that [the doctors are] probably thinking that she&rsquo;ll never know. You know what I mean? I don&rsquo;t know, maybe they&rsquo;re writing them off as a lost cause figuring they&rsquo;re never going to get off drugs, so they&rsquo;ll never really know that they got sterilized, they just won&rsquo;t get pregnant anymore. So, I don&rsquo;t know how to get inside somebody else&rsquo;s head, but I understand the frustration, I do.</p>
<p class="p2">
	I totally get it. which is why I do what I do. But I don&rsquo;t make anybody do what they don&rsquo;t want to. That&rsquo;s the difference. I offer them money, yes, because money get&rsquo;s everybody&rsquo;s attention. Everybody&rsquo;s motivated by money. The money gets their attention and keeps them focused long enough to follow through and do what they know they need to do anyway. So it&rsquo;s basically keeping them focused long enough to do the responsible thing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Do you consider it a bribe? Would you use that word?</strong><br />
	Some people call what we do a bribe. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me what people call it. The word doesn&rsquo;t really matter. The bottom line is that what we&rsquo;re doing is working. So the bottom line is that we&rsquo;re going to bribe, we&rsquo;re going to, whatever you want, the bottom line is that we&rsquo;re going to get people who are using drugs and alcohol on a daily basis to not conceive a child that&rsquo;s going to end up most likely in foster care, damaged. I mean we&rsquo;re going to prevent that. So that&rsquo;s more important than the word bribe.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	If we bribed known people with DWIs to not get behind the wheel of their cars while intoxicated no one would have a problem with it. These women have innocent victims as well. I could have used many words referring to why the women in jail would have agreed to being sterilized that&#39;s just the one that came out. We offer incentives to the addicts we pay, and I could have asked if the jail offered incentives. My point is I can only hope that you don&#39;t use a word to take the importance away from what we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	I just don&#39;t understand why the media can&#39;t just focus on the problem and the solution. Why is it always necessary to try to make me look bad in any way possible?</p>
<p class="p1">
	<strong>Y</strong><strong>ou have a simple answer to a complicated problem, and you present it with a lot of certainty. I think the certainty that you project is why reporters like me keep wanting to talk to you.</strong><br />
	I agree that we aren&#39;t solving every problem, but we are however solving our one piece of this problem. I think the reason our donors feel good donating to us is because we actually stop a problem unlike most non-profits that fund ongoing problems.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I realize that you have to play devil&#39;s advocate, and write for those who disagree with our work, but like I told you those speaking the loudest against us and for the addicts right to continue having children aren&#39;t willing to adopt them. If you&#39;re not part of the solution you&#39;re part of the problem.</p>

<title>VICE News: Russian Roulette: The Invasion of Ukraine - Part 29</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	Before VICE News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky was detained on April 21 and held by pro-Russia separatists in Sloviansk, he filed this dispatch featuring an interview with his future captor, the city&#39;s self-appointed &ldquo;people&rsquo;s mayor,&rdquo; Vyacheslav Ponomarev. Simon was released on Thursday.</p>
<p>
	Simon went to Sloviansk to investigate reports of a shooting at a checkpoint outside the city on Easter Sunday. At least three people were reportedly killed in the incident. Pro-Russia forces and Russian media outlets quickly blamed the Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector for the assault. After interviewing local Ukrainian police, who couldn&rsquo;t confirm the number of deaths, Simon attended a press briefing where he questioned Ponomarev directly about the alleged shooting.</p>

<title>Heroin Is the Most Dangerous Way to Increase Your Creativity</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/heroin-is-the-most-dangerous-way-to-increase-your-creativity</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 17:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150291/heroin.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 418px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">&quot;Very agreeable,&quot; says Damon Albarn. Photo via <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Heroin_asian.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	The thing about heroin is that you can&rsquo;t say anything good about it&mdash;at least not in public. That&rsquo;s what gangly Brit pop singer Damon Albarn discovered when, in a <a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/damon-albarn-talks-heroin-use-interview/" target="_blank">recent interview</a>, he admitted that his experience on the H-train was &ldquo;incredibly creative&rdquo; and &ldquo;very agreeable.&rdquo; This caused a mild media furor, with various <a href="http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/04/21/blur-singer-damon-albarn-says-his-heroin-use-was-very-agreeable-very-creative-as-he-plugs-new-solo-album/" target="_blank">publications</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/21/damon-albarn-defends-past-heroin-use" target="_blank">crying foul</a>, and commenters completely flabbergasted by how he could think using heroin is anything but the worst thing that could ever happen to a human being ever in the history of horrible things. It&rsquo;s the same sort of public discomfort that arises when <a href="http://www.ottawasun.com/2013/09/30/ottawa-residents-voice-their-opposition-to-supervised-injection-site">discussing supervised injection sites</a> or <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/doctors-in-bc-can-no-longer-prescribe-heroin">doctors being able to prescribe heroin</a> to help addicts lead a somewhat normal life. Heroin = bad, right? For the most part, I see where this comes from&mdash;a heroin addiction is a terrible thing. Heroin is an all-consuming drug that can destroy your life, and the lives of people around you.<br />
	<br />
	But my reaction to Albarn&#39;s surprisingly candid admission was more curiosity than shock and outrage. Can heroin really make people creative?</p>
<p>
	In the echelon of narcotics, heroin has always seemed to me the least creative of drugs. I understand cocaine: You&rsquo;ve got a ton of ideas&mdash;all of which you think are awesome (even though they are not)&mdash;and weed makes everything funny. LSD is basically creativity incarnate. But heroin? Based on my admittedly limited knowledge of the drug (i.e., watching <em>Trainspotting</em> and visiting Vancouver&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/hanging-with-a-vancouver-meth-dealer" target="_blank">Downtown Eastside</a>), the only thing I really knew for sure was that heroin addicts often walk around looking super sleepy and itchy. Where&rsquo;s the artistic genius in that?</p>
<p>
	I wanted to know more, so I called up Dr. Alain Dagher, neurologist at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (a.k.a. the Neuro) to find how, if at all, drugs like heroin can help with creativity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: What can you tell me about the link between drugs and creativity?</strong><br />
	<strong>Dr. Alain Dagher:</strong> There&rsquo;s a long history of people using drugs for creativity, and different drugs act in different ways. The most obvious example of the way a drug can help creativity is that most of us are, for the most part, inhibited in many ways. Many drugs, especially in small doses, can relieve that inhibition. The best example being alcohol. Low doses of certain drugs like alcohol can cause just enough disinhibition that you can become, in a way, more creative.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What about heroin specifically?</strong><br />
	There&rsquo;s another way drugs can make you more creative, which is going beyond disinhibition. That is, making conceptual links in your brain between things that you may not normally link. So, to a certain extent, this relates to madness&mdash;there are many artists whose creativity is almost like madness, but not quite. In conditions like schizophrenia, you have thoughts that are jumbled together that don&#39;t necessarily belong together&mdash;you have tangential thinking, and thoughts go in bizarre directions, which might be helpful with coming up with bizarre ideas. Part of creativity is being original. So drugs like cocaine, and perhaps heroin, have that ability to make you have original thoughts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>So heroin can make you more creative.</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t know about heroin per se, but in the 19<sup>th</sup> century people used heroin-like drugs. All the Romantics used opiates. Drugs like laudanum and morphine were commonly used in those days for creativity with the poets and painters.</p>
<p>
	The surrealists like Andre Breton were interested in madness but also any state of mind that made you not normal. That allowed you to be creative in the sense of being different.</p>
<p>
	The other side of it is that a lot of people take heroin as self-medication. We use it in medicine as a painkiller. It&#39;s also probably helpful for people who suffer from depression and anxiety. And probably a lot of artists do suffer from that because of what they do.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Why do you think some people are so upset with Damon Albarn&rsquo;s admission?</strong><br />
	There are many reasons. The most obvious one is that drugs&mdash;especially heroin&mdash;are pretty dangerous. And you would not recommend anyone take a drug like heroin in order to become an artist. Especially heroin, it&rsquo;s probably one of the worst. It&rsquo;s extremely dangerous. A single dose can kill you. And it&rsquo;s easy to overdose. So that&rsquo;s probably why people are upset, I would guess.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you think heroin is getting a bum rap in the same way weed and alcohol once did?</strong><br />
	Every drug, except alcohol, has been demonized to a certain extent. If he said he took two whiskeys to help his creative process, nobody would have cared. I have to say, though, heroin is such a dangerous drug that I would never recommend anyone to try it even once.</p>
<p>
	I want to add that the other thing about creativity is that it&#39;s not just about being disinhibited. And it&rsquo;s not just forming associations&mdash;you have to have a certain amount of talent. You need to not just have ideas, but know what are the good ideas and what are the bad ideas.</p>
<p>
	<strong>So all this is to say that heroin might not make you super creative, but it could help.</strong><br />
	I don&#39;t want to come down morally; I&rsquo;m not an expert in ethics. But I can come down as an expert in brain science. People say that it can help them with creativity, and there&rsquo;s reason to believe that could be the case. But I want to say that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Escaping Our Depressing Plutocracy with Thomas Piketty</title>

<p>
	Many Americans continue to delight in ridiculing Karl Marx&mdash;a German philosopher who died 131 years ago&mdash;because revolution failed to overwhelm the rapidly industrializing world as he so famously predicted. Leaving aside the fact that this mockery often reeks of spiking the football decades after the end of the Cold War, and for a while there, Marx&#39;s critics had a point. The emergence of the modern welfare state, along with the incredible destruction of two world wars and the disaster that was the Soviet Union, seemed by the close of the 20th century to herald the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man" target="_blank">&quot;End of History&quot;</a>&nbsp;and the permanence of a globalized free market economy.</p>
<p>
	These days, of course, Marx is looking pretty fucking spot on. Our century has been defined so far by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/upshot/the-american-middle-class-is-no-longer-the-worlds-richest.html">exploding income inequality</a> both in the US&mdash;where it&#39;s gotten way worse under Barack Obama than George W. Bush&mdash;and around the world. Welfare regimes are being cut back across Europe, leaving the EU&#39;s brand in tatters and its future murky at best.</p>
<p>
	Swooping in to the rescue is French economist Thomas Piketty, picking up where the Left&#39;s heavily bearded intellectual Godfather left off. His&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006" target="_blank">new book</a>,<em>&nbsp;Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em>,&nbsp;uses reams of income tax data to show that the planet&#39;s wealthy will continue to accrue more and more assets and pass vast riches on via inheritance, far outstripping the ability of economic growth to distribute income as it did during that unique, magical stretch between the late 1930s and mid 1970s that Americans tend to be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/jun/06/george-packer-inside-our-new-america/" target="_blank">super nostalgic about</a>. During that time the smell of the Great Depression&#39;s bread lines still lingered, which helped convince many to ditch their qualms about European socialism and embrace programs that might keep them alive, along with the labor unions that could agitate for their interests in Congress. Marxist clubs and parties popped up around the country, which would ultimately get a lot of people in serious trouble when the Red Scare took off in the 1950s. For a time, though, life was good&mdash;assuming you were white and male.</p>
<p>
	At a mid-April lecture in Manhattan with a coterie of fellow white male economists like Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, Piketty was <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117407/thomas-piketty-speech-economics-sensation-visits-new-york" target="_blank">greeted like the global celebrity</a> he has become since the book&nbsp;was <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117498/pikettys-capital-sold-out-harvard-press-scrambling" target="_blank">translated</a> into English earlier this year (it&#39;s on the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> bestseller list and has been&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/067443000X" target="_blank">sold out</a> on Amazon for days). Indeed, the <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/04/on-tour-with-rock-star-economist-thomas-piketty.html" target="_blank">excited stories</a> about the French intellectual&#39;s meteoric rise to fame are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/books/thomas-piketty-tours-us-for-his-new-book.html" target="_blank">coming</a> out at a rapid pace, heralding the arrival of a new economic prophet.</p>
<p>
	But at the risk of being a buzzkill, I have to say Piketty&#39;s prescription for stopping the inexorable march toward oligarchy with a global wealth tax strikes me as rather naive (even he acknowledges it is a lofty, utopian goal). For one thing, if the rich are hoarding their money and we hope to drastically alter the economic landscape, a tax on wealth&mdash;even an annual confiscatory one like Piketty proposes&mdash;that pays for public goods like healthcare may not be enough.&nbsp;When millions are out of work or barely scraping by, why not cut to the chase and have the government give poor people money directly?</p>
<p>
	During a brief press availability following the lecture, I asked Piketty that very question: Why doesn&#39;t he support a guaranteed basic income, or income floor&mdash;an idea that none other than Richard Nixon <a href="http://www.remappingdebate.org/article/guaranteed-income’s-moment-sun?page=0,2" target="_blank">tried to push through Congress</a> in 1969?</p>
<p>
	&quot;I talk about a social state for the 21st century and I talk about access to basic goods such as education, health, pension, social security, and so forth,&quot; Piketty told me. &quot;I am more favorable to this approach&mdash;financing access to basic goods&mdash;than the income floor. Yes, the income floor approach was defended by Nixon, but also by Milton Friedman. The problem is that it can be good if it&#39;s a complement to access to basic goods, but very often the way it is sold is as a substitute for access to basic goods. And then I am a bit skeptical.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The Friedman reference is interesting, because to some experts on the Left, that&#39;s exactly the kind of figure Piketty is beginning to represent: a spokesman for the once excluded fringe who has the credentials and star power needed to elevate the cause into the mainstream.</p>
<p>
	&quot;Piketty is the Milton Friedman of our moment,&quot; said Todd Gitlin, professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University who served as president of Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s. Which is to say Piketty offers something you just can&#39;t find much of in most economic discourse. The entire field seemed to lose credibility, in fact, after many of its leading figures failed to anticipate the financial crisis (some of them even profited).</p>
<p>
	&quot;If you take an Econ-101 course, chances are you&#39;re going to end up in a class that is completely out of touch with reality,&quot; said&nbsp;Kshama Sawant, the Indian-American economist and Seattle City Councilwoman who made <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/29/us/a-rare-elected-voice-for-socialism-pledges-to-be-heard-in-seattle.html" target="_blank">national headlines</a> when she won election as an avowed Socialist last year.&nbsp;&quot;It doesn&#39;t even matter which side of the political debate you&#39;re on, it really doesn&#39;t match up with what you see out there in the real world.&quot;</p>
<p>
	That the word &quot;capital&quot; appears in all caps on his book&#39;s title has invited many comparisons of Piketty to Marx, whose most important work may have been his epic tome&nbsp;<em>Das Kapital</em>. But Piketty makes no bones about the fact that he is no Marxist, and instead is interested in finding a way to make capitalism more sustainable. In that sense, he is looking for ideas that can pass muster not just in continents and countries with a history of flirtation with socialist revolution like his own, but even strongly individualistic cultures where &quot;freedom&quot; reigns, such as the relatively fat and disengaged one that is still obsessed with race across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>
	The US conservative movement has thrived for decades by stoking resentment of the poor and brown, who are supposedly chilling around the house on your dime watching Richard Pryor (or maybe these days it&#39;s <em>Key &amp; Peele</em>). These are the so-called &quot;welfare queens&quot; Ronald Reagan loved to talk about on the campaign trail in southern cities with a history of racial terrorism, and while the right&#39;s leaders aren&#39;t quite that shameless anymore, they continue to dominate the rhetorical wars.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s much easier for people on the Left to want to take money from the rich than to give it to the poor and working class,&quot; said Michael Kazin, a social-movement historian at Georgetown University and co-editor of&nbsp;<em>Dissent</em> magazine. &quot;Democrats are spending more time attacking the Kochs than they are talking about how we need to restore unions and institute a $16 minimum wage.&quot;</p>
<p>
	But while cartoonish plutocratic villains like the Republican Party&#39;s 2012 nominee Mitt Romney are fun to laugh at (and the idea of taxing their wealth year after year sounds awesome), what remains unknown is how to propel change through a rigged system that&mdash;<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/shock-news-a-princeton-study-revealed-that-america-is-an-oligarchy" target="_blank">breaking news</a>&mdash;works primarily to serve the rich. I&nbsp;don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that Piketty&#39;s book is being received so warmly a few weeks after the US Supreme Court <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/us-supreme-court-loves-corruption-now" target="_blank">handed down yet another</a> one of those depressing opinions that will make it easier for the rich to dominate our political system. Many on the Left, it seems, would prefer to stop worrying about what the world is like and go back to thinking about how it should be.</p>
<p>
	The reality is just too unpleasant to bear. Self-proclaimed progressive saviors like Barack Obama sold themselves as agents of change but quickly became creatures of the establishment. More broadly, the Democratic Party&#39;s future&mdash;at least in the short term&mdash;is really just a blast from the past in the form of Hillary Rodham Clinton, an unabashed neoliberal whose husband hangs out with shady Eastern European business tycoons while she rakes in $250,000 per paid speaking engagement courtesy of banks like Goldman Sachs. (That whole <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/will-elizabeth-warren-purge-american-politics-of-corruption" target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren thing</a> doesn&#39;t seem to be panning out, at least not yet.)</p>
<p>
	So to some campaign finance reformers, the Piketty boomlet is kind of irksome in the sense that he&#39;s providing an outlet for escape, even avoidance.</p>
<p>
	&quot;He&#39;s returning us to a world in which the political problems have hypothetically been solved, and now comes the question of what policies are needed,&quot; said Gitlin, &quot;which for a rationalist is a more joyous prospect than imagining how you get a grip on the plutocratic money-politics nexus, how you rouse a cynical and rearguard people.&quot;</p>
<p>
	None of this is to deny Piketty&#39;s incredible contribution to the field of economics. His valuable provision of a model and the hard data needed to show that capitalism inevitably breeds inequality ought to be celebrated. But if we&#39;re serious about figuring out a way to stop the past from devouring the future&mdash;a formulation Piketty uses to describe old wealth begetting future inequality&mdash;we need to get a handle on our corrupt political culture. The problem is an urgent one that cannot be delayed until the citizens of Earth (or Europe, as Piketty concedes is more realistic) join hands in favor of taxing wealth.</p>
<p>
	&quot;The Occupy movement, politically speaking, was far more significant than Thomas Piketty&#39;s book,&quot; Sawant, the Seattle Socialist councilwoman, told me. &quot;What we need is a fundamental shift away from capitalism. And for all the people who are skeptical about that or find that insurmountable, let&#39;s not forget, we have another ticking clock that is climate change. Capitalism has shown itself to be completely incapable of solving that problem.&quot;</p>
<p>
	To his credit, Piketty did devote a small subsection of his book&#39;s final chapter to climate change, but man, getting those politically hyperactive oil barons to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/179461/new-abolitionism?page=full" target="_blank">part ways with $10 trillion in wealth</a>&nbsp;in a system where money counts as speech&nbsp;is going to be a slog&mdash;even with the Frenchman&#39;s book in hand.</p>

<title>Australia Will Buy Any Fighter Jets the US Tells It To</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150333/australia-will-buy-anything-america-tells-it-to.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 481px;" /></p>

<p>
	Australia&rsquo;s alliance with the US is a linchpin of its defense policy. And to have a close relationship with the US is to have a close relationship with the American arms industry. On Tuesday, Australia&rsquo;s record-breaking $12 billion purchase of 58 stealth fighter jets made headlines. Politically the timing seemed poor. The government of Prime Minister Tony Abbottis planning on making cuts to health and welfare in next month&rsquo;s budget and a large military purchase looks bad. But Australia&rsquo;s budget is not the driving force behind the decision.</p>
<p>
	Last week the <em>Dallas Morning News</em> <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/business/headlines/20140416-defense-cuts-prompt-lockheed-bell-to-seek-new-markets.ece" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that Lockheed Martin is stepping up efforts to sell foreign nations its 5<sup>th</sup> generation jet, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, or JSF.&nbsp; Lockheed needs foreign sales to act as a sort of financial cushion due to growing concerns about the size of the US Defense budget. Washington is winding down the war in Afghanistan, and automatic budget cuts&mdash;caused by the 2013 government shutdown and the Budget Control Act of 2001&mdash;are set to keep defense spending capped over the next five years. This is especially bad news for the F-35 because of the program&rsquo;s reputation for budget blowouts.</p>
<p>
	As <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2014/04/23/lockheed-wins-out-over-taxpayers-in-the-f-35-procurement-nightmare/" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;by Bernard Keane on <em>Crikey,</em> the F-35 Lightning II has been a &lsquo;procurement nightmare&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s cost more than double the initial expected investment, been burdened with poor management (the program&rsquo;s head was recently sacked), been delayed so much that last year Australia bought more of the old Super Hornet jets to address a shortfall in operational capacity, been derided by numerous official reports, and&mdash;to top it all off&mdash;last year the fleet was grounded because one of the planes had <a href="#ixzz2zgohYIdm">cracks</a>&nbsp;in the engine mounts, fuselage stiffeners, and bulkhead and wing flanges. To translate for non-technical people, they&#39;re not all that great, which the Pentagon all but confimed when they <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_au/read/the-uss-stealth-fighter-is-too-heavy-and-slow" target="_blank">rewrote its performance test so that the dumbed-down superjet could pass.</a></p>
<p>
	If the automatic budget cuts go through in the US, the Pentagon is <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-15/lockheed-to-lose-17-f-35s-under-automatic-pentagon-cuts.html" target="_blank">planning</a>&nbsp;on reducing spending on the F-35 by $1.7 billion, buying 13 fewer than planned. Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher C. Bogdan, the officer who oversees the F-35, explained to <em>National Defense</em>&nbsp;magazine (which is run by the National Defense Industrial Association or NDIA) that the fewer F-35s ordered from Lockheed, the greater the cost of each jet. According to the magazine, &ldquo;Bogdan predicted that an expected surge in orders from foreign buyers will help bring production costs back down.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In other words, Australia to the rescue! Just as other countries&mdash;such as Italy, Turkey, and Canada&mdash;are <a href="http://breakingdefense.com/2014/04/dod-says-f-35-costs-drop-but-hill-aide-predicts-rise-peo-slams-pratt-whitney/" target="_blank">considering scaling back</a>&nbsp;their purchases of the jets, Australia is ramping up its acquisition. Not that this is a splurge or an impulse buy; on the contrary, Australia has been involved in the development of the F-35 since 2002. And, except for a hiccup in 2008 when then-Prime Minister Kevin Rudd commissioned a report into whether the F-22 might better serve Australia&rsquo;s needs, the plan has always been to update Australia&rsquo;s aerial arsenal with F-35s.</p>
<p>
	This is why Opposition Leader Bill Shorten didn&rsquo;t make political hay out of the purchase, and went the other direction, going so far as to tell ABC radio that the F-35 was &quot;tthe right way to go,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;these defence purchases are necessary for our forward security plans over a number of decades.&rdquo; If there&rsquo;s one thing that will always have bipartisan support, it is Australia&rsquo;s military relationship with the United States government (and, by extension, its armament industry), a fact the Department of Defense&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.defence.gov.au/whitepaper2013/docs/WP_2013_web.pdf" target="_blank">White Paper</a>&nbsp;makes clear: &ldquo;Our defence policy is realistic about the limits to self-reliance. Australia continues to rely on significant support from the United States&hellip;&rdquo; and, &ldquo; it is very unlikely that a major power would attack Australia without entering into conflict with the United States&hellip;&rdquo; not to mention, &ldquo;as long as nuclear weapons exist, we rely on the nuclear forces of the United States to deter nuclear attack on Australia.&rdquo; And to keep the United States on its side, Australia will offer constant support.</p>
<p>
	At this point you might be wondering why Australia needs fighter jets at all. Perhaps it&rsquo;s as Abbott <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/2014/04/23/00/04/australia-to-spend-12-4b-on-fighter-jets" target="_blank">said</a>, that we need them as a deterrent and because, &ldquo;You just don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s around the corner.&rdquo; But we can get a better idea of how we&rsquo;ll use them in the future by examining when and how we&rsquo;ve used them in the past. The most recent conflicts Australian jets have flown in have been Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan, all in a supporting role for wars conducted by the US.</p>
<p>
	So before you question Australia&rsquo;s need for 5<sup>th</sup> generation stealth fighter jets, understand the purchase was never really a debate about &ldquo;if&rdquo;, it was, &ldquo;how many?&rdquo; And the answer is up to one hundred. Australia has ceased to question its ties with the US; for better or worse the alliance is the bedrock of its foreign policy. If that entails spending a record amount of money on planes while cutting back on grannies, kids and sick people, so be it.</p>

<title>Do Independent VR Developers Care that Facebook Bought Oculus Rift?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/do-independent-vr-developers-care-that-facebook-bought-oculus-rift</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 16:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150197/Oculus-Rift---Developer-Version---Back-jpg--5496--3670-.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 426px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">The Oculus Rift mask. Photo via <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Oculus_Rift_-_Developer_Version_-_Back.jpg" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</span></em></p>
<p>
	<a href="http://wingedpixel.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Ellem</a> is a fedora and popped collar short of looking like a spy. Waiting for a streetcar in Toronto, wearing a long coat, and holding a small black case branded with an eerie eye symbol, he&rsquo;s en route to meet about 30 other dudes with their own identical spooky cases. They are tinkerers, programmers, and enthusiasts. The ominous box is the proto-packaging for the Oculus Rift, that face-hugging virtual reality gizmo that has caught the attention of newbs after being acquired by Facebook for $2 billion. This marked a seismic change in the attitudes of Oculus diehards, who helped the product grow through Kickstarter donations. The fate of Oculus, as it has joined the big leagues, is an oft-debated issue in the VR geek community. So I tagged along to learn how independent developers in Toronto feel about Facebook&rsquo;s $2 billion acquisition of the highly futuristic VR platform.</p>
<p>
	Facebook interrupted the device&rsquo;s&nbsp;grassroots narrative. While the acquisition drew <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/news/modern-folk-hero-notch-continues-walk-lonely-road-truth/" target="_blank">deep, immediate loathing</a> from Reddit and <em>Minecraft</em>&nbsp;creator Markus Persson, developers working with Oculus, who penned this meet-and-greet before the Facebook deal surfaced, don&rsquo;t give a shit. The Silicon Valley stir is barely mentioned. Instead, the evening&rsquo;s subject of in-jokes is the goofy-looking <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/virtual-reality-skyrim-rocks-treadmill-oculus-wiimote" target="_blank">Omni, a treadmill add-on</a>&mdash;which, if it were made 20 years ago, would be rediscovered only through VHS tutorials at a garage sale.</p>
<p>
	Ellem, like many others, sees this Facebook glass as half full. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he and many other developers don&rsquo;t know there&rsquo;s still a glass half empty.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Would I rather they get their $2 billion somewhere else?&rdquo; says Ellem. &ldquo;Probably. Facebook games are not taken seriously, and they have no other history in games. They&rsquo;re a big unknown, not only for VR but games entirely. But people seem to be forgetting they&rsquo;re a business. They spent $2 billion on something; they think this is at least worth that. The worst case for me is, I spent $300 bucks on a Kickstarter and got a toy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The paranoia is that Facebook is disinterested in, and therefore gutting, all their weird and wonderful games. Gaming, as it exists on Facebook, is less about immersion and ingenuity and more about annoying your friends, or buying virtual knick-knacks on <em>FarmVille</em>. No indie developer wants to make Facebook-style games, but frankly, they shouldn&rsquo;t worry. There is zero evidence that Zuckerberg and Co. are hoping VR is exclusively a realm for virtual farm simulators.<br />
	<br />
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K-7cCp7QazE" width="642"></iframe><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">A trailer for VR game </span></em><span class="photo_caption">Technolust</span></p>
<p>
	As a professional game designer, Ellem&rsquo;s Oculus Rift program, <em>Echo Chamber</em>, is just a side project. He&rsquo;s not banking on it. He was just one of the presenters at the social, but not all of the speakers had games in mind.</p>
<p>
	Moments after Ellem demonstrated his software and moments before carefully spreading his business cards on a table, Trevor Koverko said he wanted &ldquo;to be the first to monetize on the Oculus experience.&rdquo; The young entrepreneur&nbsp;was recruiting programmers who&rsquo;d be interested in creating a real estate app, hypothetically allowing buyers to explore properties regardless of how many oceans are between them. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be real,&rdquo; says Koverko, &ldquo;Facebook&rsquo;s not going to trifle with the culture of this company. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re going to co-opt it, make it blue, and put logos all over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The reality is that the Oculus wasn&rsquo;t going to belong to gamers forever. While many who saw the Oculus as a platform built exclusively for gaming would likely view Trevor&rsquo;s real estate ambitions as a personal nightmare, Koverko had been making his Oculus pitch before Facebook ever stepped in, and later in the evening another programmer demoed a home-brewed VR web browser. <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/news/narrator-planet-earth-shooting-fantastic-sounding-vr-nature-documentary/" target="_blank">Even David Attenborough&rsquo;s throwing his soothing omnipotence on to the Rift with a VR film</a>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I see a big opportunity with the Rift,&rdquo; says Koverko. &ldquo;I liken it to when the iPhone came out. It&rsquo;s just a free-for-all, a land grab. The companies that move the fastest will establish themselves the quickest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Games made on the ground floor, crowdsourced and outside big industry, often have an underdog complex&mdash;entertainment for the small folk made by other small folk. The week before Facebook&rsquo;s Oculus purchase, Sony set up a David-versus-Goliath scenario by introducing their new VR headset, Project Morpheus. So nuts to that. Whatever disappointment exists doesn&rsquo;t justify the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21npjc/oculus_didnt_expect_such_a_negative_reaction_to/cgf2htj" target="_blank">death threats lunged at Oculus Rift co-founder Palmer Luckey&rsquo;s family</a>.</p>
<p>
	You&rsquo;d think if anyone were booing the system, it would be the most prominent cyberpunk in the room, Blair Renaud, who is is working on a project called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/irisproductions/technolust-true-cyberpunk" target="_blank"><em>Technolust</em></a>, which only <em>sounds</em> like a porn. He thinks those upset with Oculus are big baby whiners.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the internet at large,&rdquo; says Renaud. &ldquo;All the trolls came out to play. The Reddit thread for Oculus was just flooded that day. I&rsquo;ve never seen it so angry, which says something. The funniest were people posting on Oculus&rsquo;s Facebook page, complaining about the Facebook deal, on Facebook.&rdquo; Like other developers, Renaud doesn&rsquo;t see any problems. At least not for themselves.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I think a lot programs are going to tank now,&rdquo; says Renaud. &ldquo;Perhaps the porn business won&rsquo;t do as well, because if Facebook decides they want an app store, they won&rsquo;t allow certain content.&rdquo; Renaud also says a lot of the prototypes he&rsquo;s seen don&rsquo;t even follow the suggestions that came with the development kit.</p>
<p>
	Facebook&#39;s purchase of Oculus Rift means change. It&rsquo;s going to alter the course of virtual reality, the most obvious change being that there&rsquo;s a lot more money behind it. Oculus, till now, has been fueled and bounded by forum posts and fans.</p>
<p>
	Programmers are going to continue doing what they were already doing. For most, the change is welcome. Some spectators still seem to think the Oculus won&rsquo;t be as disruptive or impactful in a post-Facebook-acquisition world&mdash;but anyone who&rsquo;s hoping to develop a viable product for the device now sees a larger audience waiting. Children and grandparents are now part of Oculus&rsquo;s virtual reality, not just Kickstarter backers and fringe developers hoping for holodeck orgies. And that is, most likely, a good thing.</p>

<title>A Canadian in the French Foreign Legion</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150254/12bnew.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 444px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">On top of the television and radio station, Port Au Prince, Haiti, 2004. All photos courtesy of David Clouds</span></em></p>
<p>
	For nearly an hour, as Dave and his friend made moves on a chessboard carved into a stone bench, a group of Russian thugs huddled around watching a battle they couldn&rsquo;t comprehend. They would reach over, knock down the pieces, and laugh. They were sitting in a gravel-filled compound surrounded by barbed-wire-capped fences with 300 ex-cons, foreigners without status, Eastern European gangsters, and a collection of multinationals looking to sell their souls for a European Union passport and a clean slate in life. New arrivals were trucked in every couple of days by the busload, and they sized one another up in penitentiary style as roving gangs of brutes picked fights, attempting to establish some sort of pecking order.</p>
<p>
	It was rumoured the chessboard had been for around 25 years, with various unique stones gathered from the surrounding gravel representing the rooks and pawns. It was just one aspect of an unchanging nature that has guided the French Foreign Legion to train anyone regardless of nationality into what they call a &quot;closely homogenous and tightly knit group.&rdquo; It was part of the mystique that led Dave to buy a one-way ticket from Ottawa to Paris, to join the French Foreign Legion, where he was guided through an intense training regimen that involved widespread corporal punishment. It was a decision that would eventually lead into the jungles of South America, where he was paid a high premium to make up for the chances of contracting malaria and other tropical diseases. And it was the unchanging structure that partly drove Dave to make a decision that resulted in his virtual banishment from France, for fear of serving time in Legion prison were he to return.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Trials</strong></p>
<p>
	&quot;There was a general rule in the Legion that the best way to cope with corporal violence was to just tense up your muscles, show no pain, and wait until the deliverer got bored and moved on,&quot; Dave said in reference to the three kicks a Romanian corporal administered to his chest at the end of a day in basic training (anyone who moaned or showed reaction would only get it worse).</p>
<p>
	The <a href="file://localhost/(http/::en.legion-etrangere.com:mdl:info_seul.php%3Fid=80&amp;idA=110&amp;block=6&amp;idA_SM=0&amp;titre=foreign-legion-today" target="_blank">Legion&#39;s website&nbsp;</a>describes itself as &quot;the military aspect of the ancient tradition of welcome and integration into French society&quot;&mdash;a welcome that has led to the deaths of 35,000 Legionnaires since the unit&#39;s creation to supply reinforcements to the French army in 1831, one year after the French conquered the city of Algiers. The Legion describes them as &ldquo;foreigners who have become sons of France not by blood received but by blood shed.&quot; They have been involved in both World Wars, as well as every other battle in which France has committed arms.</p>
<p>
	In Dave&#39;s experience, this &quot;ancient tradition of welcome&quot; often manifested itself in punches, kicks to the shins, or, one time, rocks thrown at his face after a corporal punished him for taking a sip of his tin cup without permission. It took three tosses to connect.</p>
<p>
	&quot;To be fair to the Legion, there&#39;s a hundred new assholes every day that they are seeing,&quot; Dave said. In training they were all given French lessons but in the beginning there wasn&#39;t a lot of communication between the dozens of Russians, British, Germans, South Africans, and other nationals. &quot;It&rsquo;s easier to punch them in the head and point to the door,&quot; Dave said in relation to the language barrier. &quot;They&rsquo;re going to get the picture pretty fast.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Unlike many applicants who sign up in hopes of escaping debt, a poverty-stricken country, a criminal record, or even a spouse, Dave&#39;s initial decision to join one of the world&#39;s most hardcore military outfits came down to boredom. The Ottawa native was as an infantryman in the Yugoslavian civil war after joining the Canadian military at 17 and later served in the intelligence branch in Central Africa. He quit the military again with a wave of others, due mostly to dissatisfaction with the way the government responded to conflicts in Somalia, Yugoslavia, and Rwanda. But a couple of years into civilian life had him &quot;so fucking bored it was unbelievable,&quot; and he missed the kinds of adventures he&#39;d already experienced in his military life overseas. He tried to get involved with an aid organization running in Africa, but when that fell through, he decided to join the Foreign Legion.</p>
<p>
	When he first arrived at a recruitment center at the Fort de Nogent, east of Paris, it was cold, misty, and &quot;kind of romantic.&quot; He gave up his passport&mdash;the last time he&rsquo;d see it&mdash;and the gate closed to a lock behind him. He was &quot;in the fucking Legion.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Dave and his fellow new recruits were taken to a room where they undressed so someone could take notes of their bruises, tattoos, or scars. Stripped of their possessions and basically naked,&nbsp;they were seated and presented with a five-year contract to sign. They were also given a new identity. David Clouds&mdash;itself an alias Dave uses because he wants to remain anonymous to the Legion&mdash;was given a random name chosen off a list based on his actual initials. As long as he lasted the five years in the Legion, he would be given a French passport under an assumed identity. David Clouds had already ceased to exist.<br />

	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">On the border between French Guiana and Brazil, 2004</span></em></p>
<p>
	For the next three weeks, while wearing a tracksuit too big for him, he passed the physical tests in a consistently hungry state due to the appetizer-size meals they were given&mdash;at points it got so bad that he ate from the garbage can.</p>
<p>
	Dave was then asked a series of questions by French special police officers who apparently already knew his life story. &quot;They knew the school my brother&#39;s kids went to in Alberta. It was fucking impressive.&quot; They wanted to know if he&#39;d ever done anything stupid, or committed a crime. He told them about a time when he&#39;d caught huge shit for getting drunk in the Canadian army and stealing a car on a Belgian airforce base. The officer laughed and said that was hilarious.</p>
<p>
	But things didn&#39;t get any easier at that point. The 18 &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; were soon taken to &ldquo;the Farm&rdquo; for initial training at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains. They spent a snow-clad December in a long stone building about 200 years old that was almost completely unheated. Here the meal sizes improved, but they were only given three minutes to eat them&mdash;Dave never managed to finish a single meal in the 30 days he was there. The trainees spent their time learning Legion history, basic operational procedure, taking French language lessons, training on weapons, and working up to a 31-mile march at the end of the initial training.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Brainwashing</strong></p>
<p>
	&quot;The unique singularity of the Legion takes root in its capacity to animate and maintain this specific state of mind which permits the ultimate and unusual sacrifice,&quot; the Legion&#39;s website says. But to Dave, it was more like a cult than a professional military organization. The way he sees it, if you superimpose the Foreign Legion&#39;s characteristics on top of a cult, there&#39;s a lot more similarities than if&nbsp;you superimpose it onto a military outfit like the British Parachute Regiment. The physical punishment, hardcore work, disrupted sleep, and lack of food, combined with the fact that they were constantly telling you to forget your past, created what Dave sees as a kind of brainwashing.<br />

	<em><span class="photo_caption">On the border of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, November 1992, with 3 PPCLI</span></em></p>
<p>
	One of the training staff&#39;s favorite things to do was to line everyone up in the morning on the parade grounds, sometimes in their underwear, and let them freeze for 40 minutes (the only time they were allowed jackets, gloves, or hats on their shaved heads was during their regular night marches). Most people were constantly in some form of sickness, and while the corrective beatings continued, corporals sometimes punished transgressions by forcing people to jump into a pond called &quot;Le Petit Lac.&quot; A week before their time there ended, the whole section was ordered to strip naked and dive into the ice-rimmed pond. One Moldovan guy named Mozes&mdash;&quot;known for being a bit of an individualist&rdquo;&mdash;refused to get in, and the rest of the group watched from freezing water as the Romanian corporal &quot;motivated&quot; him through combat-boot clad kicks to the guy&#39;s thighs. &quot;It was right out of a World War II concentration camp film,&quot; Dave says.</p>
<p>
	Once Mozes&#39;s rampant string of individualism had been curbed, the group was ordered to stand by the pond and chant Legion songs&mdash;but Dave committed the heinous crime of clattering his teeth too much to sing, as frostbite was settling in on his nose, ears, and hands. A lieutenant slapped him in the face and stated, &ldquo;You can&#39;t sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	They eventually completed the epic march over the course of a night and day and were officially graduated in their shiny white kepi hats and traditional dress uniforms. In a kind of twisted Legionnaire sense of vacation, they were then all made to march up the slopes of a mountain in the Pyrenees with a heavy pack, skis, and an automatic weapon; then they spent the next few days learning out to ski &quot;black-diamond routes with an assault rifle on your chest, James Bond&ndash;style.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Three more months of basic training followed, and the only marked improvement was that the troops received longer meals. They were slowly guided toward the combat regiments they wanted&mdash;some would go to Corsica, a mountain unit and cavalry unit would stay in France, and some would travel to Djibouti. After six months without contact with friends, family, or anyone in the outside world, the new Legionnaires were given a three-day vacation in Marseille. Afterward, they began to be packed off to their regiments. Dave was off to French Guiana, where he would gain a specialty as a sniper and a secondary in demolitions.</p>
<p>
	As for Mozes, a sergeant offended by the Moldovan&#39;s individualism took him into a room and &quot;used his body as a punching bag&quot; in the last month of basic training. Dave heard he deserted shortly after.</p>
<p>
	<strong>French Guiana</strong></p>
<p>
	They called it a Deep Mission. Around 100 Legionnaires were based in the small town of Kourou in the middle of French Guiana&#39;s coastline. They were divided into sections that rotated month-long shifts patrolling the border to watch out for cocaine smugglers and people conducting illegal gold-mining operations in the jungles. Shortly before Dave arrived, a man was nearly killed by a venomous spider bite on a mission. His fellow Legionnaires immediately submerged him in a nearby creek to cool the skyrocketing body temperature the venom caused and blasted open a landing pad with explosives after radioing for help. A chopper guided by a red smoke saved him just in time (if you aren&#39;t treated within six to eight hours of the bite, you can die).</p>
<p>
	The jungle patrol missions could involve any number of run-ins with snakes, spiders, armed drug traffickers, or, in one case, a column of marauding ants that was around 15 feet wide and a little over half a mile long that made a chattering noise as they swamped the camp &quot;like a blanket.&quot; In the face of such an army, even the mighty Legionnaires couldn&#39;t do anything except get out of their way and wait until they passed. Dave went into his first deep mission weighing 175 pounds and came out at just 140 or so, covered in a shaggy beard because accidental razor cuts could quickly lead to infection in the jungle.</p>
<p>
	Nonetheless, Dave said that the deep missions were a relief because you got to escape the strict regimentation of the base. Back in Kourou there would be almost daily room inspections, and you had to deal more with the &quot;bullshit politics&quot; in a base he says was full of racism.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150258/French-Guyana-2.jpg" style="width: 632px; height: 750px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">French Guiana, 2005</span></em></p>
<p>
	Otherwise they spent their time in Kourou going through a strict jungle routine to limit the chances of catching malaria. They were always on anti-malarials, and the routine involved covering up as dusk settled in and getting off the ground into hammocks. &ldquo;Everything in the jungle hunts at night,&rdquo; he said, and to lower the chances of scorpion stings or malaria, the Legionnaires were made to be extremely strict about getting in sync with the way the jungle operates. They were even given an acne medicine because bugs hated the smell of the stuff. &quot;You have great complexion in French Guiana&mdash;you have no pimples on your face,&quot; Dave says. But nonetheless a mosquito somehow&nbsp;always made its way through. &ldquo;Tons and tons of Legionnaires get malaria for life from going to French Guiana,&quot; Dave says.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Escape</strong></p>
<p>
	One of the reasons for the constant training is to be ready if something happens, and France&#39;s involvement in the aftermath of the coup d&#39;&eacute;tat that removed Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power in 2004 provided just such an opening. Dave spent four months in Haiti securing the French embassy and Port-au-Prince airport, evacuating diplomats and monitoring a new presidential election. It was during this time that one of his friends in the outfit got shot. Although there had always been a sense of danger, this intensified the reality of the scene for Dave.</p>
<p>
	&quot;It was a reminder that I could lose my life in this organization, and it wouldn&rsquo;t be for anything Romantic&mdash;it would be for something stupid,&quot; he said. Others had also died in French Guiana&mdash;mostly from drowning during river crossings. The high points of life for Dave were a trip to Central America to train with the Salvadoran army and the odd day guarding a perimeter around the European space agency site during a launch.</p>
<p>
	The daily regimentation also began to weigh on his spirit. &quot;The regimentation is there because it&rsquo;s a tradition that&rsquo;s worked for over 150 years,&quot; Dave said. And while he admits that if they took the regimentation away, it could lead to fighting or worse problems, he had personally had enough of a place where the whole group continued to lose their days off, among other collective punishments, for the transgressions of an individual. While he understood the Legion was an escape for a lot of people, for him it started to be the opposite. With two years left on his contract, he started to look at escaping into Paramaribo in Suriname, but there was no Canadian consulate there, and the Legion had taken his passport when he first joined.</p>
<p>
	<br />

	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">On the shooting range, French Guiana, 2005&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
	His opportunity came when he received a seven-week vacation in France. He spent his first day getting hammered, then the next morning began looking for ways to cross into Spain on Lonely Planet&#39;s Thorn Tree Forum. A few days later he was on a train to the border. He knew if he was caught trying to leave the country he would face possible jail time and be sent straight back to Kourou to finish his contract. But he was determined to get to the Canadian Consulate in Barcelona. He crossed the border through the Pyrenees and caught a bus in the Spanish side. A tense moment passed when some border police got on and checked for a passport he didn&#39;t have. He made an elaborate and drawn-out show of shuffling through his bag in the hopes that the man would eventually get bored, and for some reason, it actually worked. The guard continued on and exited the back of the bus.</p>
<p>
	At first, the Canadian consulate in Barcelona refused to help due to the fact that he voluntarily gave up his passport to another country, but the woman at the desk was German, and a few words in her native tongue softened her up to Dave&rsquo;s case. After two months of hanging around in Barcelona, he was once more David Clouds, the Canadian&mdash;passport in hand.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Freedom</strong></p>
<p>
	Dave can never return to France, and is still wary of traveling to countries such as Mali where he may come into contact with the Gendarmerie, who would see his name come up on Interpol as a Legion deserter and potentially arrest him. &ldquo;I regret not being able to go back to France, but it&rsquo;s just something I had to give up,&quot; he said. &quot;France is a beautiful country, and it has a beautiful history, and beautiful people live there.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In search of the kind of adventure that had initially pushed him into the structured life of a Legionnaire, Dave set off on a life-changing one-year trip that took him from Morocco to Jordan and then from Kenya to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (he&#39;d always wanted to travel through Africa). His career in the Legion had left him equipped for most danger&mdash;so much so that to this day he still has random companies call up asking him to do contract security work for jobs with varying degrees of sketchiness. It had also left him with loads of salary built up over the last three years&mdash;and tax-free, due to the fact that he was &quot;a fictional person that didn&#39;t exist.&quot; He&#39;d received a $25,200 bonus the Legion gave French Guiana volunteers because of the risk of malaria and other diseases.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150261/DSC010023.jpg" style="width: 563px; height: 750px;" /><br />
	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">On parade in French Guiana, 2004</span></em></p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I had the attitude that I could do anything,&rdquo; he said, and besides all the bullshit, his experience with the Legion is not one that has left him bitter. &ldquo;I joined the Legion ultimately for adventure, and I definitely got that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>
	Now he skydives, plays guitar in a band in Ottawa, and bartends at a tiny, boisterous pub that attracts a random assortment of characters from the surrounding neighborhood. He pours drinks with military precision and falls back on a kind of bartending tradition sometimes lost in today&#39;s world of generic Irish pubs and cell-phone societies. He engages with the regulars with a humble friendliness, imbuing the place with a charm that goes beyond its scattered decor of hanging lobster traps and old armchairs. Every surface is kept sparkling clean, and every glass stands in its proper place.</p>
<p>
	As I sit on a stool on a relatively empty night, he tells me a story about Africa shortly after he left the Legion. In Uganda, a guy jumped out of the bushes while Dave was walking down the road and tried to snatch his bag. Dave turned and open-palm-struck him in the throat. &quot;I fucking dropped him in two seconds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>
	The guy picked himself up and escaped into the bush, but it was unclear whether he&#39;d realized a valuable lesson about fucking with an ex-Legionnaire. In fact, he had probably had no idea what he&#39;d been up against.&nbsp;<br />

<title>There Are Still Broken Bones Buried Under Bangladesh&#039;s Collapsed Sweatshop</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/rana-plaza-world-trade-centre-identification-of-dna</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150214/0kaisar-wed-7.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Rescuers at Rana Plaza waiting in line to carry out the dead bodies retrieved from under the rubble. Photos by Atish Saha</span></em></p>
<p>
	One year ago today, a nine-story factory building named Rana Plaza in Savar, Bangladesh, collapsed, killing 1,116 workers and injuring many more. Some of their bodies are still in the back lot, waiting to be found.</p>
<p>
	Images of the wrecked building&mdash;layers of concrete pancaked from roof to street&mdash;made it perfectly clear how severe the collapse had been. A year later, the site looks a lot different from the one you see in those photos. It&#39;s now an empty gap in a dense commercial strip, a rare blank in one of the most crowded, swiftly developing nations on Earth. But like the World Trade Center site before it, the grim history of this place has temporarily delayed redevelopment. Besides an ugly hammer-and-sickle statue left there by some communists, nothing has been added.</p>
<p>
	Curiously, almost nothing has been taken away, either. A week after the collapse, heavy construction machinery moved in and started to shift the piles of broken concrete to an undeveloped lot a few yards away. The wreckage is still there, unsearched. It is known to contain body parts of workers who died in the collapse. The question is why they&#39;re still there and what this means for the families</p>
<p>
	At another historical atrocity, some 12 years and 7,000 miles away, the approach to human remains was very different. <a href="http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/unidentified-remains/" target="_blank">After</a> the World Trade Center attacks in 2001, a hunt began with the excavation of Ground Zero. Eventually, the results of the search included bone fragments retrieved from locations as far away as the gravel roof of the Deutsche Bank Building. To date, the New York Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (NYOCME) has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/10-years-21000-bone-fragm_n_951513.html" target="_blank">cataloged</a> more than 21,000 human remains and matched two thirds to the 2,794 victims of 9/11.</p>
<p>
	Just as 9/11 initially overwhelmed the NYOCME, the Rana Plaza atrocity overwhelmed the Bangladesh National Forensic DNA Profiling Laboratory. In the seven years between January of 2006 and February of 2014, the Bangladeshi lab <a href="http://www.mspvaw.org.bd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=189&amp;cmp=1&amp;adfile=1" target="_blank">profiled</a> just 222 homicide cases, or about 31 a year. Rana Plaza killed 1,116 people&mdash;basically three decades of homicides in a single day. The lab had nowhere near the kind of funding or equipment the NYOCME had. In fact, the lab in Bangladesh was unable to efficiently identify the deceased until the FBI <a href="http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2013/jul/02/us-offers-help-dna-testing-rana-plaza-victims" target="_blank">donated</a>&nbsp;some software.</p>
<p>
	However, in other ways the identification work is easier than 9/11&#39;s. The World Trade Center attacks were an &ldquo;open manifest mass fatality&rdquo; in a dense section of Manhattan, which meant the total number of victims was unknown. The force of explosions had also &ldquo;vaporized&rdquo; some bodies, and fires as hot as a cremation chamber burned for days. At Rana Plaza, there was one-third the amount of victims, and casualties were clearly limited to workers inside the building. The disaster crushed and<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/06/world/asia/struggle-in-bangladesh-to-save-collapse-survivor.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;&amp;gwh=E24A7E743D4B47F02999043F512EB708&amp;gwt=regi" target="_blank"> burned&nbsp;</a>some bodies, but it didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;vaporize&rdquo; or cremate anyone. This means that identifying the remains of every person who lost his or her life in the Rana Plaza atrocity is theoretically possible.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Heavy machinery used during the cleanup operation.</span></em></p>
<p>
	In practice, identification has its limits. The process hinges on extracting DNA, chemically processing it, and comparing with samples from living family members. Software like CODIS quantifies matches and assists in certainty, but while DNA sometimes lasts a long time, extracting enough DNA for a conclusive match can become more difficult over time if the tissues are left exposed to harsh conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In the wreckage behind Rana Plaza, what&#39;s left of workers has been dumped into a kind of landfill of garments and concrete&mdash;not ideal conditions for preserving DNA. The people looking for body parts are not scientists or government personnel, but the bereaved families of the dead.</p>
<p>
	This neglect has led to another problem: there are more people waiting for bodies than there are actual bodies. By mid May, some 550 people had registered as family members with the DNA lab, which held samples from only 321 individuals. Now, a year after the collapse, <a href="http://dvi-forensic.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/rana-plaza-building-collapse-7-more.html" target="_blank">207</a>&nbsp;bodies have been identified. Over 100 bodies remain unidentified, but some 300 families are waiting for a lost loved one.</p>
<p>
	Mere <a href="http://nymag.com/news/9-11/10th-anniversary/sneha-anne-philip/" target="_blank">absence</a> was enough to constitute a death after 9/11, though some disappearances were highly ambiguous, and the identification of bone fragments was often purely to allow families some closure. In a gesture of sensitivity, the 9/11 memorial eventually even <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/arts/design/sept-11-memorial-museums-fraught-task-to-tell-the-truth.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">classified</a> voice recordings of the deceased as &ldquo;human remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In Bangladesh, where people still gather at the old factory to weep for missing loved ones, no such respect exists. According to government <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24080579" target="_blank">policy</a>, missing Rana Plaza workers must be identified by a DNA match before their families can receive compensation, even though there&#39;s basically only one possible answer for what happened to those workers.</p>
<p>
	This is partly because of misidentifications in the atrocity&rsquo;s chaotic aftermath. Last April, hundreds of family members came to Savar. Amid their panicked searching and overwhelming grief, they identified the <a href="http://www.vqronline.org/reporting-articles/2014/04/ghosts-rana-plaza%E2%80%94part-2" target="_blank">first</a> recovered bodies through their phones, ID cards, or clothing. To relieve overcrowding, rescuers buried unidentified bodies in Jurain cemetery (many of whom have now been identified via DNA samples rescuers obtained). About 777 bodies were also hurriedly given to loved ones, sometimes in error.&nbsp;Meanwhile, criminals laid claim to a few cadavers and their 20,000 taka ($257) payouts, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/world/asia/bangladeshi-lab-struggles-to-identify-rana-plazas-dead.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">dumped the corpses, and escaped with the money</a>.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150217/0kaisar-wed-10.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">The factory site shortly after the rescue operation closed</span></em></p>
<p>
	The fact that fraud of that kind happens here demonstrates something important about Bangladesh: the level of poverty is so crushing that some are willing to <em>steal a stranger&#39;s corpse, </em>just for the $257 payout. It&rsquo;s crushing for the actual families of the dead, many of whom were destitute before losing a major breadwinner. The humanitarian function of DNA identification after 9/11 was to allow families emotional closure. In Bangladesh today, it would also enable families to eat.</p>
<p>
	Families now <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/25/bangladesh-workers-missing-rana-plaza" target="_blank">allege</a>&nbsp;that the government is obscuring the true number of victims to push down compensation payouts, while a Bangladesh Garment Manufacturing and Exporters Association representative has told the press that families are &ldquo;village people who are unclear about how they can properly trace [their living family members].&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The information that could end the debate is readily available; it&rsquo;s in the rubble directly behind the old factory.</p>
<p>
	In the soccer-field-size lot, concrete chunks are piled high. Scattered throughout is a m&eacute;lange of purchase orders, lunch boxes, and cheap garments. While scalps and other large bones are visible, there are likely plenty of smaller fragments hidden among the rubble. Family members may want these for identification purposes, but the larger bones are the only ones retrievable by untrained observers.</p>
<p>
	And there are many of these amateur archeologists. Scavengers earn a living sifting through the rubble to find salable scrap metal; sari-clad women hunt; children hammer concrete off reinforcing bars. Standing on a pile of rubble, scavenger Laila Begum thinks about coming across bones for a long while. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen [any],&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>
	But a local man named Khalil told me that he believes bones are there. <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:EmAzZLo21qEJ:unbconnect.com/rana-plaza-bones/+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk" target="_blank">And he&rsquo;s right</a>. This December, children collected more than 100 body parts and turned them in to Savar police. According to the police chief, it was the fifth time that month.</p>
<p>
	For now, there is no word on whether those remains will be tested.</p>

<title>How the Military Collects Data on Millions of High School Students</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150495/high-school-test.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></span></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Photo via <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Participantes_do_Enem.jpg" target="_blank">Wikimedia Commons</a></i></p>
<p>
	The calls started when I was a junior in high school&mdash;always in the evening, always after <em>The Simpsons</em> and always with an older gentleman on the other end of the line.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Charles, there&#39;s someone who wants to speak you,&rdquo; my mother would yell from the kitchen. She showed no concern as she handed me the phone, no alarm in her eyes over all the calls she was getting from strange middle-aged men looking to chat up her vulnerable teenage son. That&#39;s because these creepers called themselves &ldquo;colonels&rdquo; and &ldquo;sergeants,&rdquo; which lent authority to their predation. These men were military recruiters &ndash; and the bed they wanted to get me in was housed in some barracks.</p>
<p>
	A few weeks earlier, a uniformed Marine had come to my high school, set up an efficient little booth in the cafeteria and, in exchange for a stupid hat or a bumper sticker, convinced me and some other boys desperate to be men to give him our names and home phone numbers. After that, at least once a week I had to deal with a recruiter calling me &ldquo;dude&rdquo; or &ldquo;man&rdquo; while promising that military service would allow me to see the world and sleep with many of its women.</p>
<p>
	I never did join up, but the recruiters kept calling&mdash;once they have your information, it&#39;s pretty hard to get them to admit defeat. And they have a lot of people&rsquo;s information.</p>
<p>
	More than 30 million Americans between the ages of 16 and 25 have details about their lives stored in a Pentagon registry called the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nyclu.org/milrec/jamrs">Joint Advertising Market Research Studies</a>&rdquo; (JAMRS) database, their names, phone numbers, email addresses, ethnicities, and other identifying information available to recruiters 24 hours a day. Since 2001, any school that receives federal funding is required under the No Child Left Behind Act to provide the Pentagon such data on all students in 11th and 12th grades, as well as grant recruiters access to their campus.</p>
<p>
	By filling out a form, parents can stop schools from sending information on their children to military recruiters. But the military has another means of getting that information: the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB), an aptitude test that requires students to provide even more information than required by No Child Left Behind Act to recruiters.</p>
<p>
	Administered by the Department of Defense at over 12,000 schools, the ASVAB assesses a student&rsquo;s fitness for both civilian and military careers; the score you get determines which branches of the armed forces you can join. In some school districts, taking the exam is voluntary, but in others it&rsquo;s required, meaning teenagers have no choice but to give their personal information over to the US military. If a student&rsquo;s district is one that mandates the test be taken and the results forwarded to the Pentagon, there is no way to opt out, for either students or their parents.</p>
<p>
	The <a href="http://www.usarec.army.mil/im/formpub/REC_PUBS/man3_01.pdf">official Army manual</a>&nbsp;for recruiters makes says the ASVAB is a treasure trove of useful material, noting that the exam provides the sort of information &ldquo;not available from any other source,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;military aptitude composites, and career goals,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;the most current contact information for each student.&rdquo; Recruiters should encourage students to take the exam, the manual says, ostensibly &ldquo;to help them prepare for postsecondary school or the job market,&rdquo; but the real motive is generating &ldquo;academically prequalified leads&rdquo; and &ldquo;the best potential prospects to contact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Schools have long been used as military recruitment centers&mdash;as training grounds, in fact, with &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R40827.pdf">hundreds of thousands of secondary students</a>&rdquo; undergoing military instruction on high school campuses well before they can legally consent to enlist.</p>
<p>

<p>
	&ldquo;Our position is, in brief, that schools should not release person information about students to the military or anyone else without parental permission,&rdquo; said Jeanne Leblanc, the spokesperson for the ACLU of Connecticut. As it is now, she told me, &ldquo;Even when parents or a student over the age of 18 file a form instructing schools not to release personal information to military recruiters, the form doesn&#39;t apply to ASVAB test results or the accompanying personal information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In March, the Connecticut state education committee advanced a bill that would forbid schools from automatically handing the military ASVAB results or any information on those who take it. The 22 to 10 vote was along strict partisan lines, with every Republican voting no. The law would have been a partial return to the 1990s, when Connecticut had a law barring schools from handing over student contact information to recruiters; that was overturned by No Child Left Behind, which included a provision that specifically overturned &ldquo;Connecticut State law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	After passing the committee, the bill, <a href="http://cga.ct.gov/asp/CGABillStatus/CGAbillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=SB423">SB&nbsp; 423</a>, should have been put to a vote in the Senate, where Democrats control 22 out of 36 seats, and then the general assembly, where they hold 98 of 151. In other words, Republican opposition couldn&rsquo;t have stopped the bill from becoming law&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t need to, because the Democrats did that themselves.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The Veterans&#39; Affairs Committee met this morning and killed the bill,&rdquo; said state Representative Jack Hennessy, the Democrat who chairs that committee. &ldquo;To my knowledge, parents already have this ability to limit the dispersal of information and thought it unnecessary,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Hennessy is wrong&mdash;if students are forced to take the ASVAB by their school, parents have no way to stop the military from getting their information.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Our understanding is that the military lobbied hard against it,&rdquo; Leblanc told me. &ldquo;While it&#39;s not unusual for a bill to be referred through multiple relevant committees, this bill was not relevant to Veterans&#39; Affairs,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;It&#39;s about student privacy and parental rights, not veterans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Connecticut would not have been the first state to ban schools from giving recruiters data from the ASVAB. Maryland and Hawaii have enacted statewide bans, while the nation&rsquo;s largest school districts&mdash;New York and Los Angeles, as well as Oakland and San Diego&mdash;have likewise stopped administrators from automatically handing recruiters test results or any other information on students who take the exam, though a federal judge <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Judge-tosses-laws-restricting-recruiters-3295184.php">overturned</a>&nbsp;voter-approved initiatives in California that would have barred recruiters from contacting minors.</p>
<p>
	The military has not been happy about the push to protect student privacy. At a March 10 hearing before the Connecticut Education Committee, Lieutenant Colonel Michael D. Coleman of the US Army Recruiting Battalion in Albany <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/EDdata/Tmy/2014SB-00423-R000312-Department%20of%20the%20Army-%20Lieutenant%20Colonel%20Michael%20D.%20Coleman-TMY.PDF">urged lawmakers</a>&nbsp;to reject any restrictions on his recruitment efforts.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When scores are not released to military recruiters, parents and students miss out on a valuable career exploration tool and may not receive information about opportunities available to them in a civilian career field or career in the military,&rdquo; Coleman said, adding, &ldquo;Participation&hellip; is voluntary and is not a ruse to gather personal information on students for recruitment purposes,&rdquo; though he conceded that the Pentagon does of course &ldquo;benefit from the enlistment eligibility information for military service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Coleman didn&#39;t convince any Democrats that day&mdash;at least, none on the committee&mdash;but his words may have persuaded those in leadership positions to put a halt to any reform.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&#39;s not a good day for transparency or democracy,&rdquo; said Pat Elder, director of the National Coalition to Protect Student Privacy, when I asked him what he made of the Pentagon intervening in Connecticut politics to defeat a reform that, as of March, enjoyed significant support in the legislature.Still, according to Elder&#39;s organization, 40 percent of Connecticut schools have already opted not to provide the military ASVAB data.</p>
<p>
	But as Coleman pointed out in his testimony, the &ldquo;primary lead generation source for the military services&rdquo; is not that data, but the directory information&mdash;names, addresses, telephone numbers&mdash;that No Child Left Behind requires schools to hand over, unless parents remember to opt their child out, which few do. (Many likely don&rsquo;t even know it&rsquo;s an option.) And even if that form is filled out by a student&#39;s legal guardians&mdash;in case you&rsquo;re wondering, what the student wants doesn&rsquo;t matter, as the law does not respect the agency of minors&mdash;the Department of Defense will still include in its recruitment database whatever information it can gather elsewhere on that student, unless yet another opt-out form filled out, in which case the Pentagon promises to delete what it has (though who really knows if it does or not).</p>
<p>
	If we want to protect young people in America, more needs to be done to protect them from military recruiters, who we know deliberately target teens with limited life experiences and few career opportunities in order to manipulate them into making a life-altering decision at the confused age of 17. They devote years to this con and go about like any other predator, with the Army recommending that recruiters linger at all the &ldquo;popular hangouts&rdquo; and start young, noting that &ldquo;establishing trust and credibility with students&mdash;even seventh- and eighth-graders&mdash;can positively impact high school and postsecondary recruiting efforts.&rdquo; Meanwhile, all those <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/08/29/sirota_military_movies/">blockbuster movies</a>&nbsp;and desensitizing <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/playing-war-how-the-military-uses-video-games/280486/">video games</a>&nbsp;made with the direct assistance of the Pentagon ensure those 12- and 13-year-olds will have heard variations of the pitch long before they meet their first recruiter.</p>
<p>
	Since effectively doing away with the draft, the military has been forced to fill its ranks with volunteers. However, not many people are willing to kill for a bachelor&#39;s degree&mdash;and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have given potential recruits a reminder that military service is more than just a way to pay for college. That has in turn forced the Pentagon to adopt data-mining tactics, using aptitude test results and racial and economic backgrounds to determine who is most likely to buy what it is selling. But if the government is going to prohibit tobacco companies from marketing to young people, reasoning that such people are too immature to legally kill themselves with cigarettes, there&#39;s no reason the military can&#39;t wait until they are legal adults before it tries to kill them too. Unfortunately, in our democracy, it appears the military gets the final say one what&#39;s appropriate.</p>

<p>
	Last month, members of extreme right-wing group G&eacute;n&eacute;ration Identitaire (GI) launched an &ldquo;anti-scum security tour&rdquo; in the subway system of the northern French town of Lille. About 30 men in yellow raincoats gathered on March 14 and 25 to patrol the trains running on the Transpole network, apparently with the goal <a href="http://www.metronews.fr/lille/tolle-a-lille-contre-les-milices-anti-racailles-des-identitaires/mncq!fGzuhjjltrZQA/" target="_blank">of imposing</a> a &ldquo;deterrent presence against thugs who attack and steal with impunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	A bunch of far-right activists marauding around an enclosed underground space in search of their definition of &ldquo;scum&rdquo; obviously doesn&rsquo;t sound like a particularly good thing. So it&rsquo;s understandable that a lot of people got pretty up in arms about the initiative&mdash;not least the French NGO Human Rights League, which released <a href="http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2014/03/28/97001-20140328FILWWW00396-la-ldh-denonce-les-tournees-anti-racailles.php" target="_blank">a statement</a> claiming that the GI&rsquo;s patrol was intended &quot;to serve as a propaganda tool for their extreme right splinter ideas.&rdquo; Transpole representatives also said that they were &ldquo;deeply disapproving&rdquo; of the GI action.</p>
<p>
	One problem with the GI&#39;s apparent goal is that <a href="http://www.rtl.fr/actualites/info/politique/article/lille-la-ldh-denonce-les-tournees-anti-racailles-de-generation-identitaire-7770812200" target="_blank">there are already</a> 450 officers and 3,600 security cameras active across the Transpole network, so it&#39;s unclear why any further deterrent is needed. However, one other potential motivation for the &ldquo;anti-scum&rdquo; campaign becomes apparent when you look at <a href="http://labrique.net/numeros/numero-38-janvier-fevrier-2014/article/lille-au-sud-du-peripherique-on" target="_blank">a recent survey</a> conducted by local newspaper <em>La Brique</em>, which concluded that certain neighborhoods in the city suffer from &ldquo;an unemployment rate fluctuating between 30 and 40 percent,&rdquo; while also housing &ldquo;a large concentration of immigrants of mixed origins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re a member of an extreme far-right group, seeing those two bits of information next to each other is presumably enough ammo for a whole album of spoken-word hate speech. I wanted to know whether that was the actual reasoning behind the GI&#39;s &quot;security tour,&quot; or whether they actually believed they were protecting people by standing around and intimidating subway passengers. So to find out I spoke to Aur&eacute;lien Verhassel, head of GI in Flanders, Artois, and Hainaut&mdash;three of Lille&#39;s most important historical areas.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>VICE: Why did you organize these &ldquo;anti-scum&rdquo; security patrols?</strong><br />
	<strong>Aur&eacute;lien Verhassel:&nbsp;</strong>They were launched as part of our &quot;Generation Anti-Racailles&quot; [Anti-Scum Generation] campaign. We believe that young people are the main victims of this culture of insecurity in our country. There aren&#39;t many people who&#39;ve never been abused or mugged on the streets, and we have to live with this reality.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did your first security patrols go?</strong><br />
	Our security patrols went well. Most importantly, they paid off. Our presence is enough to scare the scum off the subway; thanks to our presence they can no longer commit crimes with impunity. We had some very positive feedback from subway users&mdash;everyone welcomed our group of vigilante youth.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Don&rsquo;t you think that the law enforcement agents already working in the subway can handle this kind of problem sufficiently?</strong><br />
	French people confronted by these hateful scum groups feel isolated and scared, mostly because no one taught them how to cope with scum. We want to break this pattern and show young people that they can defend themselves. We also want scum to understand that playtime is over. That&rsquo;s what our campaign is based on. Our slogan sums it up pretty well: &quot;Join our clan&mdash;when faced with scum, you&rsquo;re not alone anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>There are 450 officers and 3,600 security cameras active across the Transpole network. You&#39;re really saying they can&#39;t handle it?</strong><br />
	We have received many complaints from Transpole staff [about problems in the subway]. They all say that [Transpole having] full control has been to the detriment of the subway users&rsquo; security. The response time is too long, and the mediation officers are useless. This is why we&rsquo;re suggesting an alternative: a police for public transport.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150107/13175461463-cdf1084054-z.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 425px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>Has crime actually increased in Lille recently?</strong><br />
	Yes, without a doubt! We see it every day on public transport, in front of high schools, universities, and night clubs. The annual crime report for the city of Lille is overwhelming. The document is meant to be a secret, but a reporter from <a href="http://www.lavoixdunord.fr/"><em>La Voix du Nord</em></a>&nbsp;[a local newspaper] got his hands on it and the case came to light. It reveals that there was a 65 percent increase in violent robberies between January and August of 2013.</p>
<p>
	<strong>The Human Rights League have accused you of spreading &quot;propaganda for your small extreme right-wing group, as well as&nbsp;</strong><strong>a stigmatization of foreigners and other disadvantaged groups.&quot; What do you say to that?</strong><br />
	The Human Rights League should start worrying about crime. G&eacute;rard Minet [regional secretary of the Human Rights League] accusing us of that is a shame. We are a youth movement, and there are certainly more disadvantaged people among our members and supporters than within the Human Rights League. If G&eacute;rard Minet is genuinely concerned about human rights and not about political propaganda, then he should do something about the increase in violence that undermines our fundamental right to move and live safely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150109/13175322225-26094e9890-h.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 425px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>But still, you&rsquo;ve called it an &quot;anti-scum&quot; campaign. Isn&rsquo;t that name bound to cause controversy?</strong><br />
	There are no taboos in G&eacute;n&eacute;ration Identitaire. We&#39;re not calling these thugs &ldquo;young people&rdquo; like the mainstream media do in order to cover this &ldquo;togetherness&rdquo; nonsense that&#39;s progressively turning into a nightmare. Semantic contortions are not enough to overshadow what people experience every day in our streets.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>Regardless, the language you use is only going to add fuel to the fire.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Have you scheduled any more patrols?</strong><br />
	Police presence in the subway has strengthened lately. We&#39;re so pleased about our effective actions! You know, we weren&#39;t there to replace the police, but to alert the authorities [of the problem]. As a committed group, we are supposed to press right where it hurts to make people react. These security tours wouldn&rsquo;t be needed if the mayor and the police were doing their job. But, for now, I&rsquo;m happy to announce that other security patrols will be organized in even more northern cities and all over France.</p>

<title>We Asked an Expert What Would Happen if Oil Became Obsolete</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/what-would-international-relations-be-like-if-oil-wasnt-important</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 24 Apr 2014 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150367/OIL-2-web-spt.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Illustration by Sam Taylor</span></em></p>
<p>
	This month, in a &ldquo;game-changing&rdquo; development, the US Navy said it had developed technology that allows its ships to make fuel from nothing but seawater. In other words, we officially don&rsquo;t need oil any more.</p>
<p>
	Of course, this <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/can-we-really-fly-planes-on-seawater" target="_blank">may be bullshit</a>.&nbsp;Theplan is nowhere near as green as it sounds and is also pretty impractical, but it did get me thinking. Oil is often stuck under pristine locations or countries that necessitate some kind of invasion before we can get to it. So what would it mean for world conflict and international relations if, thanks to future technological developments, oil were no longer such a big deal? Would we still be friendly with dodgy oil-rich regimes? Would &ldquo;No blood for oil&rdquo; stop being a protest slogan and simply become a political reality?</p>
<p>
	I spoke with Dr. Walter Ladwig III, an international relations professor at Kings College London, to find out.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150368/26-14r-co2-h2-fuel-test-630x531.jpg" style="width: 630px; height: 531px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Navy experts trying to power a tiny aircraft with a liquid hydrocarbon fuel. Photo courtesy of US Naval Research Laboratory</span></em></p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: I want to begin with the idea that this new seawater-based technology could power sea vessels without their having to refuel, meaning they could theoretically run for years. What effect do you think this would have on the world&rsquo;s naval conflicts?</strong><br />
	<strong>Walter Ladwig III:</strong> The first thing to say is that there are already ships in the world, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, that have a power source that would allow them to operate, in theory, indefinitely; but they don&rsquo;t. And the reason is because fuel is obviously a very important part of the equation here. But there are a lot of other things that affect how much endurance a naval vessel has.</p>
<p>
	There are other things a ship needs [for its endurance], like the crew. You also need lubricants and spare parts, and things break constantly on ships, so if you solve the fuel problem, people expect ships to run forever, but that&#39;s not the case.</p>
<p>
	<strong>If ships were to become less susceptible to damage as technology improves&mdash;and then <em>could</em> run indefinitely&mdash;how could that affect naval warfare?</strong><br />
	Well, if you merge it with drone technology&mdash;there are <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/technology-quarterly/21598318-autonomous-cargo-vessels-could-set-sail-without-crew-under-watchful-eye" target="_blank">stories</a> out there that people are investigating the idea of largely autonomous cargo ships, so if you solved the crew problem that could be part of it.</p>
<p>
	The second thing to say is that, right now, it&#39;s just the big five&mdash;the nuclear powers, plus India&mdash;that even have naval nuclear propulsion. So if the technology is simple and could be replicated by a lot of other countries, the real change is going to come with smaller nations, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, who will be able to have naval vessels that stay at sea a lot longer. That&#39;s where you&#39;ll see a big change.</p>
<p>
	At the end of the day, the use of naval force and skirmishes is all driven by politics. I don&rsquo;t know to what degree there are skirmishes that are not happening that would occur if the technology were there, but maybe we&rsquo;d be seeing more action and territorial disputes in the South China Sea between Chinese vessels and Malaysian, Filipino, and Vietnamese [vessels].</p>
<p>
<!--recommended-->	I also think there could be room for more [confrontation] if you look at the US and China; if two vessels come close to each other, or if Chinese and Indian vessels began to shadow each other or bump up into each others&rsquo; territory&mdash;and the <em>Financial Times </em>runs a story about the &quot;dangerous games in the Indian Ocean&quot;&mdash;there would certainly be more opportunities for those to happen. There would also be more opportunity for states to signal or maybe send messages to each other by moving their vessels here and there, which could contribute to a broad escalation, but I think you would still need the politics in which to do it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>If this technology could also be used to power cars, homes, and businesses&mdash;if oil became obsolete, basically&mdash;what do you think the geopolitical ramifications would be?</strong><br />
	Well, it would certainly be the case that oil-producing nations would be far less important to the United States. Since the Carter administration, the US has undertaken a strategy to try to safeguard, in its view, the stability of the Middle East, and to protect tanker lanes and ensure that no hostile country could dominate too high a percentage of oil production. But [ if that were to happen, the Middle East] would be a region that would be far less important.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you think America would maintain its close relationship with, say, Saudi Arabia?</strong><br />
	The actual importance of Saudi Arabia would decline significantly, because the utility of its oil would go away. I also feel its endemic social problems would rise. That&rsquo;s the other thing: From a geopolitical standpoint, I think we would see an Arab Spring on steroids, when a lot of these conservative Gulf monarchies&mdash;which basically use their oil wealth to buy off political dissidents&mdash;are no longer able to do that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150370/oil-with-ammends-web-spt.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 435px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Illustration by Sam Taylor</span></em></p>
<p>
	<strong>What effect do you think this new energy technology would have on the developing world in nations that rely heavily on oil?</strong><br />
	That&rsquo;s a tough call. For countries like, for instance, Nigeria, which gets so much of its wealth from oil, you think there would be significant [damage to its economy]. That being said, if unlimited energy was suddenly available to everyone, we&#39;re talking about electrification, so there is some kind of trade off there. In the short term it probably would be pretty bad, in the sense that the money they are getting from oil would go away right away. The benefits from this would probably take longer to roll out.</p>
<p>
	Also, another argument: in some of these places in Africa, China, and South Asia, you&#39;re already in a place where roads in major cities are gridlocked, and we haven&rsquo;t got to the stage where the average man owns a car. In Delhi, it&rsquo;s already practically impossible to get from one side of the city to the other. You could imagine that if everyone had access to cheap fuel some of these major cities would grind to gridlock.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Russia&rsquo;s economy is obviously very dependent on oil. What effects do you think it would have on them?</strong><br />
	It&#39;s a bit silly that Russia&rsquo;s economy is lumped into this [group of wealthy countries], because Russia&rsquo;s growth and development over the last decade or more has almost only been on the back of commodities: oil and gas. If those are suddenly largely worthless, with a massively shrinking population, it&rsquo;s hard to see what kind of diversification Russia could do. It will still be, for a time, important, because of its nuclear weapons and its large conventional military. But those things would suddenly be unsustainable if the government can&rsquo;t pay the bills.</p>
<p>
	We would expect to see a big drop. At the same time, we might reach into the problems of the early 90s, with loose nukes around the various &lsquo;stans. Suddenly Russia can&rsquo;t keep the lights on, then we might be majorly concerned by this nuclear arsenal. What would happen to it? So Russia could become a major problem zone.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you think maybe terrorist groups could become more powerful as the government becomes weaker?</strong><br />
	It depends&mdash;certainly in places like Chechnya, where there are already undercurrents of dissent.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you think, without oil, Russia would lose its grip on Eastern Europe? How would it change what&rsquo;s happening in Ukraine, for instance?</strong><br />
	It would become much less able to influence affairs. But when you talk to Eastern Europeans, Russia&rsquo;s military power is a lot closer to them and they are a lot closer to Russia than the West.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you reckon the UK might move closer to Europe and further from away from its &quot;special relationship&quot; with America?</strong><br />
	I don&rsquo;t know if it would lead to a significant change in relations, either to the US or to Europe, in the sense that the Anglo-American alliance is as much about a shared vision for the world and its supporting institutions. Oil is probably a significant part of the alliance, but I don&rsquo;t think it&#39;s anywhere near the sum total.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Thanks, Doctor.</strong></p>

<title>Can Unions Save Atlantic City?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/can-unions-save-atlantic-city</link>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/149664/Taj-Mahal-Atlantic-City-New-Jersey.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photo of this beautiful Atlantic City casino via <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Taj_Mahal_Atlantic_City_New_Jersey.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	The sidewalk along Oriental Avenue is packed with chanting, cheering workers waving signs and grinning at one another as they pass in an unending loop beneath the tallest building in New Jersey: the bankrupt Revel casino.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s here!&rdquo; one worker says in wonderment, after helloing a passing acquaintance. That&rsquo;s a bit of an overstatement; in reality there are only a few hundred of Unite Here Local 54&rsquo;s 11,000 members, and many of the marchers work in Revel, which is the only nonunion casino on the strip. Now that the towering casino-hotel complex is bankrupt, and buyers are circling, the union is trying to get a foothold here too.</p>
<p>
	Not that these jobs are all that great. As Revel&rsquo;s fortunes have failed, there have been thousands of layoffs, and everyone has been reduced to part time, with no benefits and no raises. That&rsquo;s nothing like the employment standard Atlantic City maintained for the past three decades, a weird corner of the post-1970s world where working-class people could earn middle-class incomes in an increasingly low-paid service-sector economy. But now, as casino gambling spreads across the Eastern Seaboard, Atlantic City&rsquo;s casino market is contracting, and workers&#39; privileges are diminishing.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I was able to buy a home in Ventnor [a beach downtown from Atlantic City], raise three sons&mdash;all of them went to college&mdash;we lived the good life,&rdquo; says Eve Davis, who has been a cocktail server at the Showboat for 27 years and worked in the casinos for 31 years total. &ldquo;We had a fabulous boom, and now we have the downturn. They have taken everything they can and left people desperate for jobs. I&rsquo;m worried that I&rsquo;ll still be able to maintain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Since 2006, when Pennsylvania&rsquo;s first casinos opened up&mdash;<a href="http://gamingcontrolboard.pa.gov/?p=180">strategically positioned</a>&nbsp;to cut into Atlantic City&rsquo;s market&mdash;the industry&rsquo;s revenue has been falling every year, and the jobs along with it. In the peak years of the 1990s, <a href="http://www.nj.gov/casinos/financia/histori/docs/year_end_2003.pdf">50,000 people</a>&nbsp;were employed in the casino-hotel complexes. Now the number is <a href="http://www.nj.gov/lps/ge/casinohotelempfigures.html">30,302</a>&nbsp;after the closure of the Atlantic Club, where 1,600 jobs were lost. Asked if she thinks more casinos will close, Davis says, &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s definitely going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The long winding line of casino workers can be heard from a few blocks away, periodic chants punctuated by noisemakers and shrill whistles: &ldquo;Tell the whole darn world this is union territory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	That isn&rsquo;t an overstatement. For as long as casinos have dominated the city, Local 54 and other, smaller unions have represented the vast majority of the industry: Hotel cleaners, barbacks, cocktail servers, cooks, waiters, blackjack dealers (who are actually represented by the United Auto Workers). All of them have been well paid and enjoy rights at work that <a href="http://www.alternet.org/economy/its-all-too-easy-get-fired-america-49-50-states-you-can-be-fired-any-reason">most Americans lack</a>.</p>
<p>
	In the early years after the casinos began opening up, the Mafia used Local 54 as a wedge into the industry&mdash;a relatively unregulated corner of an island gambling mecca that was created with a raft of provisions to keep wise guys out. In the 1980s, vicious mobsters like Nicky Scarfo and Phil Leonetti <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mafia-Prince-Inside-Americas-Violent/dp/0762445831">had</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;a seemingly limitless skim from Local 54&hellip; which [they] treated like their own petty cash fund,&rdquo; collecting (as in stealing) between $50,000 and $100,000 in cash from their cronies every month.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I got word that the president of one of the casinos wasn&rsquo;t going to sign a union contract with Local 54,&rdquo; Leonetti recalls in his memoir, <em>Mafia Prince</em> (he eventually became a government witness and testified against his fellow gangsters). &ldquo;I sent word to the president of the casino that if he didn&rsquo;t sign the contract that I personally would blow his brains out of his head. He signed the contract the next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But that era is long over. In 1990, Leonetti fingered the mob-affiliated staffers of Local 54 in a court-ordered takeover, cleansing it of criminal influence. Now the union is led by Bob McDevitt, who worked as a barback , and who has been president since 1996. The union is now known for an active membership that joins pickets and, occasionally, strikes (the last in 2004), when in disputes with the companies.</p>
<p>
	Today the union is largely composed of Hispanics and other recent immigrants from South Asia, Vietnam, and Africa. Atlantic City is home to the most <a href="http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/difference_between_margate_atl.html">diverse census track</a>&nbsp;in all of New Jersey (the whitest is farther down the island, in Margate). It isn&rsquo;t just foreign migrants who come looking for good jobs: Davis has a lot of friends who commute from across South Jersey, a tourism-dominated region where some counties have full employment in the summertime and desperate unemployment in the winter. Atlantic City was a bastion of good year-round jobs and supplied a steady stream of major construction projects to the building trades, new hotels, casinos, and parking garages.</p>
<p>
	Most of the people who have made their living in Atlantic City do not choose to live there. Some neighborhoods have been largely untouched by the casino boom, like the majority African American Back Maryland, and crime and poverty are unusually high. When the gaming monopoly still existed, though, the industry didn&rsquo;t care how shabby the surrounding city became. Dilapidation and disinvestment were arguably in the companies&rsquo; interest: Local restaurants, movie theaters, and nightclubs outside the casinos would potentially lure customers out of eyeshot of the slot machines.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;In 1978 [the year the first casino opened] there were 311 taverns and restaurants in Atlantic City,&rdquo; a witness told the National Gambling Impact Study Commission in 1999. &ldquo;Nineteen years later, only 66 remained, despite the promise that gaming would be good for the city&rsquo;s own.&rdquo; In its heyday celebrities regularly flocked to premieres in Atlantic City&rsquo;s ornate movie palaces. The last one was shuttered in 1983, and now the only theaters are inside the casinos.</p>
<p>
	When casino companies come calling in a new town, they promise jobs, tax revenue, and economic development. The latter is belied by the shabby state of Atlantic City, but it is undeniable that here and in Las Vegas a multitude of good jobs were created: In Rick Fantasia and Kim Voss&rsquo;s book <em>Hard Work</em>, they note that &ldquo;the housekeeping staffs at unionized Las Vegas hotels are paid double what maids earn at nonunion hotels in other cities. Las Vegas is now the American city where low-end service workers are paid enough to own their own homes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s not like these companies are doing this out of the kindness of their own hearts. In Las Vegas, Local 226 had to fight hard for the wins Fantasia and Voss describe. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, labor strife wracked Las Vegas, including the longest strike in postwar American history. And both Las Vegas and Atlantic City are concentrated markets that enjoyed, respectively, massive cultural cachet and a monopoly on casino gambling in the Northeast corridor. Both cities drew in tourists from outside the local area and didn&rsquo;t simply prey on locals, so the net economic benefit for the region was positive.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The way gambling companies market themselves as they come into new communities [is that] they like to talk about the successes, how their new casino towns are going to be resorts,&rdquo; says Sam Skolnik, author of <em>High Stakes: The Rising Cost of America&#39;s Gambling Addiction.</em>&ldquo; [That&rsquo;s] almost never the case... Inevitably some new jobs are created but they become more a drag on the local community socially and economically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The casinos that are mushrooming across the nation today do not have the ability to pull in outside money, and most are not union. Of the 12 casinos in Pennsylvania, now the second largest casino market in the nation outside Nevada, only two are unionized. An organizing campaign at Philadelphia&rsquo;s Sugarhouse casino has stretched on for years, and the company continues to <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/154485/should_joining_a_union_be_a_civil_right/">resist</a>&nbsp;with the help of an <a href="http://citypaper.net/article.php?SugarHouse-contracts-radical-anti-union-consultant-19424">extremely conservative antiunion firm</a>. Workers report that health care is unaffordable, wages low, managerial relations troubled, and turnover high.&nbsp; The latter is true across the state: A 2008 Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board <a href="http://gamingcontrolboard.pa.gov/files/communications/2008_Gaming_Diversity_Report.pdf">report</a>&nbsp;found that the voluntary, non-firing, turnover rate across the state&rsquo;s casinos ranged between 24 and 66 percent, well above <a href="https://www.shrm.org/Research/benchmarks/Documents/Trends%20in%20Turnover_FINAL.pdf">normal</a>. (Subsequent reports have not taken up the issue.)</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s why Local 54 is keeping the pressure on Revel&rsquo;s owners. If it remains nonunion, it will be able to offer the same kind of low-pay, no-benefits jobs it does now, which could be a tempting model for other owners. In the coming years more casinos will close&mdash;Trump Plaza has been doing very badly for a very long time&mdash;but this mega casino, the newest on the strip, will presumably not be one of them. If Local 54 wins, at least a few thousand more workers would still enjoy union protections and wages.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;When I was young there were more jobs, way more tourists&mdash;not so much now,&rdquo; says Liditze Diaz, who is pushing her stroller along the picket line. She&rsquo;s been a server at Revel for almost a year. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m raising my kid and supporting my father because he is older and it is harder for him to get a job. I had summer jobs before, nothing serious. This is my first casino job; this time it&rsquo;s a job I do need to maintain for myself and my family. Both my parents worked [in the industry], and they raised me off of casino jobs. The main difference [between their jobs and her position at Revel] is the job security. Every job my parents had was union.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Some Books Can Watch You Read Them</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/some-books-can-watch-you-read-them</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 23 Apr 2014 21:01:00 +0100</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150285/shelf1.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 859px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">The author&#39;s bookshelf. Each one watches him while he sleeps.</span></em></p>
<p>
	Do you ever get the feeling you&rsquo;re being watched? Sometimes, when I&rsquo;m sitting there in front of the computer, naked for whatever reason, I see the eye of the camera and the wires leading out of my house, and wonder whether or not someone is recording me from some florescent-lit bunker in Maryland. Thoughts like that are enough to drive some people insane. And being insane in certain ways leads, I think, to better art&mdash;or at least opens up the world in ways beyond our control.</p>
<p>
	What I&rsquo;m saying, I guess, is that the world right now feels a lot like a theater filled with countless people, each of whom are at once starving for attention, wholly obsessed with their own realm of ideas, while at the same time concerned over freedom and surveillance, solace. It&rsquo;s like every day the world is split in half, and in each half is an opposing part of your personality, and you can&rsquo;t remember the one that&rsquo;s not with you at the moment. But occasionally there are objects that force you to recall the absent part of you, like a mirror with someone else&rsquo;s face appearing where you expected to see something you recognized.</p>
<p>
	Two new books, <em>Tristano</em> and <em>Guantanamo</em>, each neither fiction, memoir, or a mirror, but somewhere in between, created that feeling for me.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150279/tristanoresize.jpg" style="width: 596px; height: 848px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong><em><a href="http://www.versobooks.com/books/1518-tristano">Tristano</a>, </em>by Nanni Balestrini (translated by Mike Harakis)</strong></p>
<p>
	<em>Tristano </em>in some way answers the question: <em>What kind of book would a computer write?</em> The major thing here is that each copy is totally unique. The text of <em>Tristano </em>consists of ten chapters, each of which consists of 15 pairs of paragraphs, two per page, and for every single edition of the book, a new combination of the order of those paragraphs within each chapter is shuffled, changing the story with each printing of the book. The number of possible paragraph combinations is 109,027,350,432,000, meaning no copy of the book will ever be the same, and every reader will have his or her own edition, to be read in that way by no one else before.</p>
<p>
	I will admit that it does sound a bit gimmicky, but there&rsquo;s an odd feeling in reading something designed to belong to you alone. My copy bears the number 10738, and I felt strangely attracted to the idea that this was a private exhibit, my own iteration of a thing being spread quietly throughout the world. It made me think about who might be holding another copy with another variation, and how that version would feel to read, what they would understand that I didn&rsquo;t, and what that meant.</p>
<p>
	Aside from the interesting concept, the writing in <em>Tristano</em> is beautiful, and intricately rendered, if also supposedly hodgepodged from many different places. Balestrini, an important face in Italian avant-garde literature alongside Umberto Eco and Edoardo Sanguineti, has a magnetic knack for stringing together musical phrases with cryptic comments and everyday sounding speech, like, on page 22 in my version:</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There were some flowers in a vase and a long sofa in front of the fireplace. My husband came toward me I was scared he was going to beat me I covered my face with my hands. Then he got into his car parked by the kerb a white car. At the end of the narrow street the traffic lights are stuck on red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	While the plot, on its face, pretends to be a love story, it does so much more with the ground it stands on that you soon forget you&rsquo;re in a story at all. Because the text from sentence to sentence within the paragraphs is the same, it is the transitions between each page that vary, and then mutate and disappear, and later reappear again and come together in strange ways, ways that exist only for you, at times seeming so perfect in its formation you forget how it came on totally by chance, not the relic of a product of another doting human, but something stranger.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/150277/guantanamo-frank-smith-vanessa-place.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 962px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong><em>Guantanamo </em>by Frank Smith (translated by Vanessa Place)</strong></p>
<p>
	<em>Guantanamo</em> creates a disarming atmosphere much like <em>Tristano</em>&rsquo;s, if in a completely different sort of world. Where the latter is full of dream language and bizarre collaborations of imagery, Frank Smith&rsquo;s book is stripped down to bare bones. And yet, hidden in its structure is a kind of suspicious air, just as mutative and singularly memorable as <em>Tristano</em> in the reading experience it provides.</p>
<p>
	The foundation of <em>Guantanamo</em> takes the bulk of its text from seven transcripts released by the Department of Defense in 2006, comprised of interrogations of suspected terrorists that took place at the Guantanamo naval base. From these, Frank Smith has tapered down the bulk of the records to strange clipped scenes of little windows into private versions of a situation that feels very much like total hell. The viewpoint shifts back and forth from the perspective of the interrogator to the interrogated until it feels like some kind of dislocated voice mashed between the two. Soon we don&rsquo;t know whose side we&rsquo;re on, who is innocent and who is to blame. The antiseptic nature of the interview model, modded by Smith to read in bursts of verse, seem somehow at once menacing and whitewashed, like we are skirting around something so fucked it almost has no feeling on the page. I love when something not alive can make me feel like it is hiding something, like I have to read what is just underneath the actual image on the page, and <em>Guantanamo</em> is overflowing with such layers.</p>
<p>
	The information supplied tells so little of what we know to be the political story, but it is fascinating in how it covers itself up, and how among all the back and forth, the denials of the suspects against the endless barrage of allegations of their work, what little scenes of anguish crop open for a second. &ldquo;Arabs should go anywhere except Jalalabad,&rdquo; says one suspect. &ldquo;All Arabs opposing the Taliban there would have been killed instantly. So what do you think? Should I have stayed, or tried to escape? They would have killed me if I had stayed, just like any other Arab. So I decided to flee. I did not know where to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I don&rsquo;t know what the truth is, or what comes from these documents. The more the questions are asked, the less the answers seem to lead us anywhere but to the fact that no one knows exactly what they are&mdash;no one can see what they have become a part of until they are outside it, and what is good and what is bad mutates the same way language does, while at its center is something no one can control. For all the horror <em>Guantanamo</em> carries, what it does not say and cannot say is by far the most deadly.</p>
<p>

<title>A Masturbation Lawsuit Is Rattling Christian Homeschoolers</title>

<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Doug Phillips, the former head of Vision Forum Ministries, is being sued by a former follower who claims he used her as his &quot;personal sex slave.&quot; Photo by Vision Forum via Facebook</span></em></p>
<p>
	Last fall, Douglas Phillips, a fundamentalist Christian homeschooling guru and leading proponent of the &ldquo;Biblical Patriarchy&rdquo; movement, shocked his followers by publicly admitting that he had a relationship with a woman other than his wife, and subsequently shuttered his popular&mdash;and lucrative&mdash;Vision Forum ministries. Given that philandering religious leaders are a dime a dozen, the story seemed pretty unremarkable at the time. Sure, it was sad news for Phillips and his fundamentalist friends, an illustrious circle that included <a href="mailto:http://www.vice.com/read/kirk-cameron-wrote-the-bible">Kirk Cameron</a>, <a href="mailto:http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/was-bill-nyes-creation-debate-the-new-scopes-monkey-trial">Creationist talking head Ken Ham</a>, and the <a href="mailto:http://www.vice.com/read/duggars-christians-19-kids-and-counting-keeping-it-modest">Duggar vagina militia</a>. But mostly, it just looked like another minister getting a taste of forbidden fruit.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There has been serious sin in my life for which God has graciously brought me to repentance,&rdquo; Phillips said in a <a href="mailto:http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/biblical_patriarchy.aspx">statement</a> posted to Vision Forum&rsquo;s website. &ldquo;I engaged in a lengthy, inappropriate relationship with a woman. While we did not &#39;know&#39; each other in a Biblical sense, it was nevertheless inappropriately romantic and affectionate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Then, last week, the bomb dropped. The woman with whom Phillips was involved, 29-year-old Lourdes Torres, slapped both him and Vision Forum with a <a href="mailto:http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/04/TorresComplaintFinalwithCoverSheet.pdf">lawsuit</a> that indicates Phillips dramatically understated the nature of their &ldquo;inappropriate relationship&rdquo;&mdash;not least by implying that it was consensual. In the suit, Torres accuses him of sexual battery, exploitation, assault, and fraud, among other charges, and claims he used her as a &ldquo;personal sex object&rdquo; over the course of several years, including while she was working as a nanny in Phillips&rsquo;s home. Torres is also suing Phillips&rsquo;s now-defunct Vision Forum Ministries, and its for-profit arm, for negligent supervision and retention&mdash;in other words, for knowing about the abuse and not doing anything to stop it or remove Phillips from his leadership roles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	According to the lawsuit, Phillips met Torres and her family at a homeschooling conference in 1999, when Torres was just 15. It claims that Phillips then proceeded to &ldquo;methodically groom&rdquo; the teenage girl, inviting Torres on family vacations, taking her on as a nanny for his kids, and showering her with compliments, money, and spiritual advice, until eventually she moved into the Phillips&rsquo;s home as a nanny in 2007.</p>
<p>
	That&rsquo;s when the allegations get gross:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	While Ms. Torres was living with Douglas Phillips and his family in October of 2007, Douglas Phillips entered Ms. Torres&rsquo;s bedroom and without her consent began touching her breasts, stomach, back, neck, and waist. Phillips then began to masturbate and ejaculated on her. Ms. Torres asked Phillips to stop and broke down crying. Despite Ms. Torres&rsquo;s repeated requests for Phillips to stop masturbating and ejaculating on her, Phillips proceeded to return and repeat this perverse and offensive conduct. Each night that Phillips returned, Ms. Torres requested that he stop. Defendant blatantly disregarded her requests but continued to masturbate and ejaculate on her each night.</p>
<p>
	The 30-page complaint goes on to sketch a devastating picture of Phillips and his ministry, offering a glimpse into the darker side of the Biblical Patriarchy movement that has taken root in some corners of Christian fundamentalism. In the belief system advocated by Phillips and Vision Forum, men have spiritual authority and dominion over church and family, while women are expected to submit absolutely to their fathers and husbands in all aspects of life.</p>
<p>
	According to the lawsuit, Phillips allegedly continued to grope and masturbate on Torres for the next five years, and even promised to marry her when his wife died&mdash;setting up an abusive Catch-22, in which Torres was compelled to submit to Phillips&rsquo;s spiritual authority, even though doing so made her &ldquo;damaged goods&rdquo; in a community that puts an outsize premium on sexual purity. In the meantime, the suit claims he had become Torres&#39;s &quot;spiritual father&quot; and the &quot;dominant authority figure&quot; in her life. &quot;Phillips was the pastor of her church, her boss, her landlord, and the controller of all aspects of her life&mdash;obedience to Phillips was as obedience to God in this total institution,&quot; the complaint reads.</p>
<p>
	What makes the lawsuit against Phillips remarkable&mdash;and a bombshell for the Christian Right&mdash;is that it is an indictment of the Biblical Patriarchy movement and fundamentalism writ large, casting blame not just on Phillips but also on the conservative doctrine that he has promoted across the country. As an icon in the homeschooling movement, Phillips was a major proponent of the idea that Evangelicals should remove themselves and their families from threat of encroaching secular government and culture.</p>
<p>
	At his own church, the suit argues, the result was an insular, almost cultish community that actively discouraged outside contact, and made it impossible for Torres to confront or escape her abuse:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	There is a pervasive sense within Phillips&rsquo;s tight circle of people that they are engaged in a cosmic war, and that they avoid contact with the government and other outside groups that might hold them accountable or ask questions. Phillips used his training as a lawyer to help foster an unregulated community that operated as a &quot;total institution&quot; where Ms. Torres would have limited access to outside support as she came to see her situation as abusive.</p>
<p>
	It gets worse:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	Douglas Phillips&rsquo;s community had its own church-court system. Disputes were brought before a board of all male elders in what resembled a legal proceeding without any of the rights of the accused in secular courts. For Ms. Torres, this system would force her to go up against Phillips&mdash;the most powerful man in the extended community&mdash;who is a trained attorney known for his skills at argument and intimidation. If Ms. Torres were to lose, she likely would be excommunicated from her church and all other churches that are legitimate in the eyes of her community. Seeking advice from others would have been labeled as gossip and treated as a very serious sin. One could be excommunicated for this, a practice that very much protects the men in power.</p>
<p>
	Torres finally cut ties with Phillips in the end of 2012, precipitating a downward spiral for the Christian homeschool icon that ended with the shuttering of Vision Forum. Although Phillips has not denied having a relationship with Torres, in statement posted to <a href="mailto:https://www.facebook.com/visionforum/posts/10150383314764964%3Fstream_ref=10">Vision Forum&rsquo;s Facebook page</a>, his lawyer claims that their contact was &ldquo;consensual and often initiated, encouraged, and aggressively perpetrated&rdquo; by Torres, and that she &ldquo;repeatedly requested money, trips, jewelry, and numerous special favors.&rdquo; <a href="mailto:http://www.worldmag.com/2014/03/set_adrift/page1"><em>World&nbsp;</em>magazine also reported</a> earlier this month that Phillips has been sending out letters to former Vision Forum board members accusing them of trying to &ldquo;destroy&rdquo; him.</p>
<p>
	The scandal is the latest in a series of recent sexual abuse crises that have rocked Christian fundamentalists and destabilized the biblical patriarchy movement. Last month, Bill Gothard, the 79-year-old head of the Institute of Basic Life Principles and one of the earliest leaders of the Biblical Patriarchy and Quiverfull movements, was <a href="mailto:http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2014/april/bill-gothard-breaks-silence-on-harassment-claims-by-30-wome.html">forced to resign</a> after <a href="mailto:http://www.recoveringgrace.org/gothardfiles/">at least 34 women, most of them former employees, accused him of sexual harassment.</a> Fundamentalist Bible colleges, often the higher-ed of choice for children of Quiverfull families&mdash;have also struggled with the issue of sexual abuse. At Bob Jones University, a bastion of fundamentalist academia, an <a href="mailto:http://www.vice.com/read/sexual-abuse-has-become-a-huge-problem-for-americas-bible-colleges">investigation is currently underway to look into accusations that the school mishandled abuse victims,</a> and covered up sexual assault incidents that occurred on campus. Patrick Henry College, in Virginia, has been <a href="mailto:http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116623/sexual-assault-patrick-henry-college-gods-harvard">dealing with similar allegations.</a></p>
<p>
	The wave of sexual abuse issue is partly the result of the Christian Right&rsquo;s push to extract evangelical Christians and their children from the encroaching threat of secular government and culture in schools, courts, and other parts of civic life, said <a href="mailto:http://undermuchgrace.blogspot.com/p/mission-statement-and-bio.html">Cynthia Kunsman,</a> an author and nurse who has written extensively about abuse in the Biblical Patriarchy movement.&nbsp; Absent secular governance, she said, fundamentalist groups &ldquo;rely upon authoritarian systems and strict hierarchies to tightly govern followers, and they control dissent through direct and indirect or subtle punishment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When combined with the Patriarchy movement&rsquo;s gender hierarchy and extensive focus on sexuality and fertility, she added, &ldquo;the culmination of these factors fosters the potential for abuse of anyone who is inferior, and women just happen to occupy the lowest positions.&rdquo; But given that the entire pitch for Biblical Patriarchy is that it is better for women, children, and families, &ldquo;dealing with sexual abuse is tantamount to admitting that the system is flawed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But there are signs that the movement is starting to crack from the stress. In the wake of the lawsuit filing against Phillips, several prominent homeschoolers&mdash;including his former colleagues at the Home School Legal Defense Association&mdash;have <a href="mailto:http://www.chrisjeub.com/patriarchy-has-got-to-go/">publicly broken with Biblical Patriarchy doctrine</a>, openly criticizing Phillips&rsquo;s conservative ideas about gender and sexuality for the first time.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I wish I had spoken up sooner,&rdquo; Michael Farris, the head of the HSLDA who also founded Patrick Henry College, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.farris.374">wrote in a Facebook post.</a> &ldquo;There was no way that I could have known that Doug was involved in sexual misconduct, but I knew that he was involved in unscriptural views about women in his teaching.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He was teaching that girls should never go to college. I started a college where half the student body is female,&quot; he added. &quot;I thought my actions would speak louder than his words. I wish I had used words too.&quot;</p>

<title>This Guy Has Been Trolling Neo-Nazis for Nearly a Decade</title>

<p>
	Last month, an extreme right-wing party called&nbsp;<a href="http://australiafirstparty.net/" target="_blank">Australia First</a>&nbsp;posted details online of the man they believed to be behind the pseudonym Andy Fleming. For the past decade, &quot;Fleming&quot; has been aggravating&nbsp;<a href="https://newmatilda.com/2014/01/22/whos-keeping-eye-aussie-neo-nazis" target="_blank">local neo-Nazis</a>.&nbsp;They aren&rsquo;t particularly pleased. He&rsquo;s received countless threats and racial abuse from them, which warrants his efforts to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>
	Studies&nbsp;<a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/were-a-weird-mob-of-unfriendly-racists-monash-university-report-20140323-35buu.html" target="_blank">show</a>&nbsp;that racism is a mounting concern in Australia, and Fleming is a natural protagonist to rise against it. He decided to take a stand after seeing the racist underbelly of the punk scene in his hometown of Melbourne. In order to evade&nbsp;a&nbsp;curb stomp,&nbsp;he needed to veil his identity. Fleming resolved to use&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)" target="_blank">Anonymous-esque</a>&nbsp;tactics to infiltrate these circles and disseminate his findings on his radio show and&nbsp;<a href="http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>. In doing so, he has garnered quite a following (the latter has received more than 2.75 million views)&mdash;and Fleming is showing no signs of stopping any time soon.</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong>VICE</strong>: <strong>How did you respond when you first saw the <a href="http://australiafirstparty.net/andyslackbastard-revealed-as-james-hutchings/" target="_blank">leak</a>?</strong><br />
	<strong>Andy Fleming: </strong>It&rsquo;s not the first time these groups have misidentified me. There was one profile on my blog&#39;s Facebook page that was repeatedly making hostile comments. I kicked them off the page, and then the leak was uploaded on the Australia First website.</p>
<p>
	I received an email from the misidentified man, who told me he was receiving some ominous calls and messages. I invited him onto my radio show to clarify things, but many of them still aren&rsquo;t buying it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did you become involved in challenging these groups?</strong><br />
	I sort of fell into the role from the recommendation of others. I opened my blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/">SlackBastard</a>,&nbsp;around 2005, as a means of channeling my political opinions. Things sort of sprouted from there.</p>
<p>
	<strong>I understand you were broadcasting information about the groups on your radio show. What was the fallout from this?</strong><br />
	There have been a number of threats towards the station. It&rsquo;s a pre-recorded show, so if the groups were to come into the station, the DJ working at the time could be identified as me. This is obviously very precarious, but the station is supportive. We are in discussions at the moment about how we can work around it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How does the punk scene relate to neo-Nazis?</strong><br />
	There&#39;s an element of punk culture that is attractive to the extreme right wing. This peaked with the neo-Nazi movements in the late 80s, and there was a lot of conflicts at the gigs. But I like to think most punks uphold the Dead Kennedys slogan: &ldquo;Nazi Punks Fuck Off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<strong>What sort of tactics have you used to protect yourself?</strong><br />
	I sometimes disguise my IP address, and I never reveal my name or traceable details. A number of people I knew who have written about the far right have received a lot of resulting intimidation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What is the worst threat you have received?</strong><br />
	There have been lots of death threats. I published a compilation of these on my blog <a href="http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/?p=36013">recently</a><strong>. </strong>There&rsquo;s also a lot of abuse arising from my presumed status of being Jewish.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What is your biggest goal in doing this?</strong><br />
	Promoting anti-fascism and anarchism. My own politics are deeply antithetical to fascism&mdash;we exist on opposite ends of the political spectrum&mdash;so promoting my views is very important to me.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How does the extreme white in Australia compare with groups in other Western countries, like the US or the UK?</strong><br />
	Nazis are marginal in Western society. This is not the case in countries like Greece and Hungary. They&#39;re on the extreme end of the spectrum, and there are a number of similar parties popping up. This has been a growth in the likes of the Tea Party in America, UKIP in Britain, and in the past One Nation in Australia. These parties express similar concerns to fascism, without being as far right.</p>
<p>
	It could be mentioned that in the West, anti-semitism amongst neo-Nazis has been largely replaced by anti-Muslim sentiment, which has been informed by the War on Terror.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are neo-Nazis orchestrating online?</strong><br />
	Many of them are very active on social media&mdash;the biggest community being&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stormfront.org/forum/">StormFront</a>. Many of these groups organize events, meet-ups, and occasionally arrange to gate-crash far-left gatherings.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How often would you say bashings&mdash;like that of Vietnamese man </strong><strong><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-16/duong-neo-nazi-bashing-banned-australia-vietnam/5204024">Minh Duong</a>&mdash;</strong><strong>are occurring?</strong><br />
	There have definitely been others incidents of migrant bashings in Melbourne, but it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to confirm the motives. It&rsquo;s difficult to distinguish them from, say, a random beating. What&rsquo;s really concerning is the popularization of the belief that these attacks are legitimized by the victims being non-white and non-Australian.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Recent studies expose that racism is the biggest concern of migrants living in Australia. In general, do you think racism is getting worse there?</strong><br />
	I do. If you look at politics and the media, race is being deployed in a way that&rsquo;s becoming increasingly vulgar and open. There&rsquo;s a large rhetoric on protecting Australia&rsquo;s borders, which invokes a lot of paranoia.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How would this be impacted by Prime Minister Tony Abbott&#39;s plan to amend the Racial Discrimination Act?</strong><br />
	I think these changes would encourage those who had been reluctant to do so to more forcefully present racism, as it will be understood to be acceptable. It would make matters a lot worse.</p>
<p>
	<strong>I understand there is a distinction between skinheads and boneheads?</strong><br />
	Skinheads developed in the UK in the late 60s and early 70s. Boneheads were the right-wing infiltration of the scene. It&rsquo;s largely contradictory that white supremacism should be a part of the skinhead ideology, because it drew largely upon Jamaican culture in terms of fashion and music. <em>Bonehead</em> is a term for the skinheads who had betrayed the roots of the culture.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How should ethnic Australians go about avoiding these groups?</strong><br />
	Swastikas are an obvious hint&mdash;but the reality is that it&rsquo;s sometimes not apparent. In many places, neo-Nazis have adopted the fashions of the far left. It&rsquo;s definitely not that easy to identify them.</p>
<p>
	They do have gatherings and concerts, so it&rsquo;s obvious that you should avoid these like the plague. The group mentality always promotes violence.</p>

<p>
	It&#39;s not exactly breaking news that the American criminal justice system is wildly unfair. The <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-war-on-weed-still-expensive-racist-and-failed" target="_blank">war on drugs</a> sends thousands of black and Hispanic kids to prison for using the same illegal substances that their white peers can more often get away with smoking or snorting; meanwhile, the Wall Street bankers responsible for the financial crisis get off with zero punishment and huge bonuses. These gross disparities in how the rich and poor are treated by the police and courts are the subject of <em><a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/book/218631/the-divide-by-matt-taibbi" target="_blank">The Divide: American Injustice in the Age of the Wealth Gap</a>, </em>a book illustrated by VICE columnist <a href="http://www.vice.com/author/Molly-Crabapple" target="_blank">Molly Crabapple</a> and written by Matt Taibbi, the former <em>Rolling Stone</em> investigative journalist who has made a career of lampooning our entitled upper class (and <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/thank-you-rolling-stone-20140220" target="_blank">just left that magazine</a> to start a new website about political corruption).</p>
<p>
	I called Taibbi to chat about how America got to this terrible, dystopian place and where we should go from here.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: The core theme of the book is that we&#39;ve seen two parallel, and very different, systems of criminal justice emerge in this country&mdash;one for the wealthy and powerful, another for the poor and brown. That concept in and of itself might not totally shock people, but the timeframe&mdash;just how novel that phenomenon is in our democracy&mdash;should, right?<br />
	Matt Taibbi:</strong> Obviously it&#39;s not a new story that the rich get off and poor people get screwed. I think that&#39;s a narrative that probably couldn&#39;t be more obvious, but there are some new developments that have made this situation worse. There are these parallel policy and political developments that happened in the early 90s that mirrored each other, with the Democrats coming over on the issue of welfare reform and also deciding to follow the Republicans in terms of courting money from the financial services and hopping on board with deregulation. I think what both of those decisions meant was that, basically, poor people no longer had a lobby in Washington consistently, and the very wealthy now had a consensus behind them. So we started to have this phenomenon of much more aggressive law enforcement against the poor. On the other side, it begins with deregulation of white-collar commerce, and then it kind of ends in non-enforcement of white-collar crime. That also seems to be a political consensus. It&#39;s not just the same old story that has gone back to the beginning of time... This is also a new political development that has to do with the alignment of the two political parties in this country and how they&#39;ve changed recently.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Broadly speaking, how does the justice system treat you when you don&#39;t have money? </strong><br />
	You get the individual attention of a human being in the criminal justice system if you&#39;re a person of means, whereas if you&#39;re a nobody you fall into this machine. It&#39;s very merciless, as I tried to document in the book&mdash;once you get put into this meat grinder, it&#39;s very very difficult to get somebody to listen to you and to your individual story, whatever it may be, while if you&#39;re a person on the other side, you get to pay a phalanx of lawyers to have a sit-down with people at the highest levels of the criminal justice system and make a personal plea, and they may very well listen to you. That&#39;s the difference: a machine for the people at the bottom and a human being for the person at the top.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is it fair to say we&#39;ve criminalized poverty in this country?</strong><br />
	It&#39;s fair to say in a sense. It&#39;s not illegal per se to just have no money. But the problem with being broke or being broke and being undocumented is it puts you in a situation where any false move will result in a negative consequence, whereas if you&#39;re working at JPMorgan Chase, there almost can&#39;t be an individual consequence for you anymore, no matter what you do [in the course of doing your job]. Your company may end up paying the fine, but you won&#39;t personally pay at all. In a way, we&#39;ve made it incredibly easy for people to become criminals when they&#39;re in that situation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Are judges basically just tax collectors now, appropriating wealth from the poor?</strong><br />
	There is actually a bizarre financial motive that drives a lot of this behavior. There are all sorts of little and not-so-little financial unfairnesses that are built into the system. One that drove me nuts was this idea that whenever you get arrested, you have to have a DNA test done and you have to pay for that. You have to pay for your own lab test, your own disenfranchisement. There are other little things, like the fact that when you are at Chase or HSBC and get fined a gazillion dollars, you can write that off as a deduction, whereas if you get a speeding ticket or you have to pay for your DNA test or pay a $250 processing fine for a prostitution conviction, you can&#39;t write that off. We&#39;re almost subsidizing white-collar crime at the top, whereas at the bottom there are all these ways we&#39;re squeezing people who don&#39;t have money anyway. There&#39;s this really awkward comic element to the whole thing, where if you&#39;re sitting and watching this over and over again, it does start to become funny and upsetting at the same time.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Why is it so hard for some poor people to get out of a cycle of prison and recidivism?</strong><br />
	Once you&#39;re in it, all sorts of things happen. If you have a conviction, first of all that will bar you from being able to get a whole range of professional licenses. In New York, if you have a certain kind of criminal conviction, you can&#39;t even work in a pet cemetery. There&#39;s hundreds of things you can&#39;t do anymore if you have a criminal conviction; it might mean being evicted from your home if you have Section 8 housing. It&#39;s already hard to get ahead&mdash;if you&#39;re trying to do it in the context of working in fast-food restaurants, you&#39;re tired, you&#39;re raising kids, you have a couple hours a day to sleep or relax. If you start adding complications, if you can&#39;t get 200 different professional licenses, you can&#39;t drive a car, you can&#39;t get public assistance, you can&#39;t get credit [because of a criminal record], you start adding all those things up, then it becomes impossible.</p>

	<strong>If we ended the war on drugs&mdash;decriminalized or even legalized all drugs tomorrow&mdash;would the prison population be immediately reduced? Or are there other structural problems and incentives that keep our incarceration rate high? </strong><br />
	It&#39;s obviously sort of a huge unwritten subtext through the whole book. One of the things that I talk about in the introduction was this thing I&#39;d seen in Russia where a certain thing was against the law, but some people could get arrested for it and other people couldn&#39;t. Everybody in Soviet Russia had [American] dollars, but only some people would get busted for that. Our version of that is the drug laws. Everybody in America does drugs. If you threw a net over Lower Manhattan on a Friday night or Saturday night, half the people you picked up would have some kind of illegal drug on them, whether it&#39;s Vicodin or ecstasy or coke. But we selectively enforce the drug laws, and we use extreme aggression in some areas when we enforce them. We do things like seize all your property, whereas on the flip side, if you look at HSBC [a bank that <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/taibblog/outrageous-hsbc-settlement-proves-the-drug-war-is-a-joke-20121213" target="_blank">profited from drug trafficking</a>], they literally could have taken all the assets of that company if they had wanted to, because that was a drug case. Instead they negotiated this settlement. So the war on drugs is the place where we get to selectively prosecute people. It&#39;s our excuse for going after one population and not another. If we got rid of it, I think things would improve, but I also think something else would substitute for that.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You suggest more than once that the Bush administration, including its Department of Justice, was much tougher on financial crime than the Obama White House. How much of the blame for that can we lay on Attorney General Eric Holder and how much can be attributed to Obama and his prerogatives? </strong><br />
	I never buy the excuse that the president has been misinformed or the president has been duped by his advisers. We&#39;ve heard that excuse in other arenas: the national-security arena, the civil-rights arena, the whole question of rendition and torture and drone assassinations. We hear people saying, &quot;Oh, if only Obama knew!&quot; This is funny for me, because in Russia they have this saying: &quot;If only the czar knew!&quot; That existed for centuries&mdash;people had this implicit belief that the czar was a good man and it was just the people around him doing all these terrible things at the local level. That speaks to the desire of people to want to believe in the goodness of their leaders. I voted for Obama; I spent time around him on the campaign trail. I like him personally, you know, from a distance, just as a person. And he&#39;s smart. But there&#39;s just no way around it&mdash;on this issue he hasn&#39;t been good. And it&#39;s hard to make any other argument that he&#39;s not responsible for a lot of this. I wish there was a way to make that argument.</p>

<p>
	<strong>You refer in the book to a sort of new model of citizenship, even a new, twisted concept of civil rights. What do you mean by that?</strong><br />
	The idea of being a citizen or being a part of a nation-state is sort of disappearing for a certain class of people. They kind of live in this stateless archipelago. They&#39;re essentially untouchable personally; they receive the benefits of living in whatever country they&#39;re in, but they don&#39;t have to make any of the sacrifices that you would normally make as a citizen. This begins with paying less in taxes than the rest of us do, and now it&#39;s extended to not having to be responsible for crimes you commit in those territories. That&#39;s the subtext of this whole thing&mdash;a collapse in patriotism among this class of people, because you wouldn&#39;t have all this totally socially nonproductive activity, like selling worthless mortgages to old people, if any of these people had a conscience or felt any burden of citizenship. They don&#39;t feel like they owe us anything.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is there a way out of this mess? </strong><br />
	I have to work at the optimism thing. But I do think one more disaster would make it almost inevitable that we took serious steps down the road to cleaning up at least the white-collar side. The other side of it, the jailing of millions of poor and non-white people, I&#39;m a little bit more worried about. There&#39;s almost an unstoppable political imperative that drives that&mdash;politicians who advocate for being tough on people from bad neighborhoods or from poor neighborhoods, they almost always do well when they [speak about] those themes. Voters respond to those themes. So even if stop-and-frisk is overturned by a judge, some politician will <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/is-going-after-subway-panhandlers-smart-policing-strategy" target="_blank">find a way to replace it</a> with some other policy that will allow them to circumvent probable cause and whatever else. I worry about that. I think the big prison numbers are a result of politics more than anything else, and [changing that] would require a shift in American attitudes, a return to a more compassionate way of looking at other people. I just don&#39;t know. I just don&#39;t see that happening terribly soon.</p>
