<title>This Week in Racism: Nick Cannon Wore Whiteface and I Cried</title>

<p>
	<em>Welcome to a White People Party Music edition of This Week in Racism. I&rsquo;ll be ranking news stories on a scale of one to RACIST, with &ldquo;one&rdquo; being the least racist and &ldquo;RACIST&rdquo; being the most racist.</em></p>
<p>
	&ndash;I get a lot of shit for not &quot;calling out black people for being racist.&quot; There&#39;s some notion that I&#39;m biased and slant my coverage of racial issues toward an afro-centric perspective. Well, thanks to Nick Cannon, I can finally try to reverse that stigma. I got that &quot;reverse racism hook-up&quot; from my boy. In order to promote his idiotically titled new album, <em>White People Party Music, </em>Nick created a character called &quot;<a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/524466/nick-cannon-dresses-in-whiteface-dubs-himself-connor-smallnut-seriously-see-the-pics" target="_blank">Connor Smallnut</a>&quot; on Instagram this week. You see, Connor&#39;s white. Not only is he white, but he&#39;s also an over-the-top caricature of a white person. You&#39;ve seen <em>White Chicks</em>, but are you ready for... <em>White Dude</em>?</p>
<p>
	Nick Cannon&#39;s really trying to shock the world, though he should realize that it&#39;s shocking enough to know that someone paid him to make music again. You already surprised me, man! Stop surprising me so much! I have a heart condition (and I also hate you)!</p>
<p>
	Shitty stereotype-based caricatures are almost always atrocious<strong>. </strong>Hardly anyone laughs at Mickey Rooney dressing up like a Chinese person in <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s</em>, mostly because it&#39;s not funny or clever. It&#39;s just a dude in a pair of fake teeth switching out L&#39;s for R&#39;s. I could do that (and I would at birthday parties if you paid me enough), and no one would think it&#39;s good, because it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>
	Nick responded to the criticism by saying <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/nick-cannon-white-big-difference-humor-hatred/story?id=23049775" target="_blank">he&#39;s just joking</a> and he was inspired by Robert Downey Jr. in <em>Tropic Thunder</em>. Of course, Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s character in <em>Tropic Thunder</em> was an explicitly mocking parody of the exact thing Nick Cannon did. Let&#39;s just say the one thing about this story that I&#39;m not shocked about is that Nick Cannon doesn&#39;t understantd a joke.<strong> RACIST</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
	&ndash;Last week, I mentioned ABC Family&#39;s highly questionable drama pilot titled <em>Alice in Arabia. </em>The show was to depict an American girl&#39;s adventures as a captive in Saudi Arabia. The script leaked online, and Arab advocacy groups lost their shit. This week, ABC Family wisely <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/258607/speedreads-abc-family-cancels-alice-in-arabia-for-its-racist-premise" target="_blank">put the show to bed.</a> The gave it some milk, a cookie, fluffed it&#39;s pillow, then smothered the show with the exact same pillow. &nbsp;<strong>2</strong></p>

	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photo via Flickr User <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/keithallison/" target="_blank">Keith Allison</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	&ndash;Daniel Snyder, owner of the Washington &quot;Redskins,&quot; has remained resolute in his disinterest in the protests of Native groups regarding the rather odious nickname his football team uses. He repeatedly restates his claim that he will never change the name of the team to anything that isn&#39;t horrible racist. Instead of just listening to the pleas of Native Americans, he&#39;s decided to throw some money at the problem by establishing a charity called the &quot;<a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/03/redskins-owners-starts-charity-so-that-youll-forget-about-the-racist-team-name/359518/" target="_blank">Washington Redskins Original Americans Foundation</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>
	From Daniel Snyder&#39;s <a href="http://files.redskins.com/pdf/Letter-from-Dan-Snyder-032414.pdf" target="_blank">letter announcing the new foundation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		&quot;The mission of the Original Americans Foundation is to provide meaningful and measurable resources that provide genuine opportunities for Tribal communities. With open arms and determined minds, we will work as partners to begin to tackle the troubling realities facing so many tribes across our country. Our efforts will address the urgent challenges plaguing Indian country based on what Tribal leaders tell us they need most. We may have created this new organization, but the direction of the Foundation is truly theirs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	I absolutely can&#39;t fault the Redskins&#39; organization for trying to reach out to the Native American community. It&#39;s a step in the right direction, and yet I can&#39;t help but be cynical about this specific gesture. The very people Daniel Snyder is trying to suck up to are the ones he&#39;s pissing off by resolutely standing by the Redskins name. At least he&#39;s trying though.&nbsp;<strong>3</strong></p>

<title>The Final Frontiers of Private-Issue New Age Music</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/tuning-the-human-instrument-0000254-v21n3</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" border="0" height="872" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/tuning-the-human-instrument/glass-pyramid.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>All photos by Elizabeth Renstrom</i></p>
<p>
	<span style="float:left;color:black;font-size:47px;line-height:35px;padding-top:7px;padding-right:5px;font-family: Arial;">N</span>ew age music: a genre despised and misunderstood by untold numbers of music fans. Its time has finally come. Douglas McGowan&rsquo;s 2013 compilation record, <i>I Am the Center: Private Issue New Age Music in America, 1950&ndash;1990</i> (Light in the Attic Records), recontextualizes the genre brilliantly and has managed to catch the attention of many who previously overlooked it. Simply put, the lifestyle and content associated with new age have acted as a roadblock for secular and serious listeners. Nevertheless, if there has ever been a time for new age, it is now.</p>
<p>
	I first got into new age by exhaustively scouring every other genre that was of interest to me. In the mid 90s I was dealing in rare records, long before the internet made every obscure but substantial title in every cool genre a known, digitized collectible. My digging partner, Tony, and I would learn what was of value and quality through experience and judgment rather than social media and blogs. We eventually fell into a working relationship with an influential Japanese record dealer who introduced us to thousands of little-known but exemplary titles over the years. Before the internet, there was no easy way to procure the knowledge it took to distinguish a record that should be worth $40 from a $4 one.</p>
<p>
	This era was a particularly exciting and interesting time for record collectors and sellers. The CD format had a firm grip on the retail market, and vinyl, considered to be the bottom of the market, was being unloaded at an astonishing rate. Many records were sold for a dollar or less, regardless of their scarcity. Even more astounding was the glut of phonographic records of all kinds. Pasadena City College would devote the entire eastern parking lot of its campus to a monthly vinyl flea market. Japanese buyers, both stereotypically relentless and undoubtedly prescient, would search the lot with flashlights in the pre-dawn hours, buying up thousands of rare&mdash;and now expensive&mdash;items.</p>
<p>
	In the late 90s, the demand in Japan for the Jackson 5&rsquo;s ABC, on the Motown label, was so high that I was able to sell hundreds of copies to my buyer for resale. Because this title kept on selling at $15 a copy, regardless of its condition, I finally asked him what was so special about this record, which could be found at almost any music store in the US. He told me that this particular title was being used as a popular fashion accessory in Shibuya, Tokyo. Young people would literally walk around with the LP under their arm, hence the sale of the record in any condition. This reframed my entire concept of the market and the product we were selling.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" border="0" height="578" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/tuning-the-human-instrument/album-cover.jpg" width="578" /></p>
<p>
	There was no way anyone could place a firm value on records anymore&mdash;evaluation now took place on a global scale, and the information about what was valuable was privileged. Things that looked cool on the outside often sounded terrible, things that looked terrible often sounded cool, things that sounded cool often had little value, and things that sounded terrible might well be worth a fortune for seemingly arbitrary reasons. The demand and trends were always in flux. Successful dealers had very open minds. Even considering long-discarded genres like Christian records and new age music was essential to making new discoveries.</p>
<p>
	So it was only natural that around this time I was traveling across the country in search of marketable records. I started to come across rare new age albums, many of which were privately pressed by individuals. Most were uncommon and some quite rare, though not necessarily expensive. New age music was in full swing in the late 70s and early 80s, which was a time when you could record an album of decent quality at home. Many of the best new age LPs from this time were self-recorded and made by simply plugging a keyboard into a 4-track, or by playing an acoustic instrument in front of a microphone. Before the internet, the distribution of this kind of album relied on a dedicated network of small, independent book and music stores.</p>
<p>
	In line with Brian Eno&rsquo;s descriptions of his late-70s<i> Ambient </i>series of albums, most of these self-released new age collections were recorded for both listening pleasure and more specific purposes, such as meditation, relaxation, affirmation, massage, and self-help. This notion created a genre of music that was both applied and marketed in a very different fashion from mainstream jazz, rock, and soul. The best examples open a window into another world. The most talented and inventive artists of this era include Joel Andrews, Joanna Brouk, Wilburn Burchette, David Casper, J. D. Emmanuel, Iasos, Larkin, Laraaji, Ojas, and Michael Stearns, among others.</p>
<p>
	What collectively came to be known and marketed as &ldquo;new age&rdquo; was in many ways a by-product of the Baby Boomers. It was the distillation of whatever vestige of hippie ideals was left after the haze of the 60s, a hodgepodge of mostly appropriated cultural touchstones that somehow formed a whole when grouped together. After the hangover of the Vietnam War, social unrest, and drug addiction, many of these men and women wanted to get it together in the 70s; they sought answers from human-potential movements, religion, cult situations, recovery programs, self-help programs, and alternative lifestyles.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" border="0" height="640" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/tuning-the-human-instrument/tower-of-candles.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p>
	Music, like most creative endeavors, was primarily seen as a vehicle for self-awareness, meditation, and recovery. New age musicians were looking to have a relationship with something beyond the material world. The notion of cosmically driven creativity was just taking shape, but it was not particularly inspired by familiar genres like spiritual free jazz, psychedelic rock, or socially and politically driven folk. New age was informed by different tones and timbres, incorporating the sounds of everything from synth-pattern oscillation, post-Kraut rock, ambient music, and electronic drums to Eastern composition, drone, field recordings, and a wide range of indigenous music, as well as soundtracks for meditation, musical accompaniment for spoken word performances, and so on.</p>
<p>
	Some of the finest examples of this somewhat vague genre were made by the Arica School, a human-potential movement that was very much thriving in the 70s. They made three records, the most essential being the remarkable <i>Audition</i>. The group was led by the Chilean guru Oscar Ichazo, whose teachings were based on the early-20th-century spiritualist and thinker George Gurdjieff. The Arica School did incredible things with art, music, dance, psychology, and calisthenics, all created with the ultimate goal of helping people reach their full potential. I remember one photograph from this era that depicts Arica School participants sitting at consoles and staring at a large geometric image known as an enneagram while listening to music through headphones. Many participants were trained musicians, from jazz players to soul and rock dudes. So musically, at these Arica School sessions, you&rsquo;d have these really long, drawn-out pieces coupled with spoken word that served to guide corresponding exercises and meditations.</p>
<p>
	At its core, new age was lifestyle music to the extreme. Steven Halpern, who is basically the godfather of new age music, realized this in the mid 70s. A doctor who made minimalist music primarily for relaxation and chakra alignment, he first pioneered the idea of making music that could heal. He was so firm in his beliefs that he advocated for the rejection of the tension-filled music of Stravinsky and others whose work reflected the atrocities of the 20th century. His books, <i>Tuning the Human Instrument: Keeping Yourself in &ldquo;Sound Health&rdquo; </i>and <i>Sound Health: The Music and Sounds That Make Us Whole</i>, provide the basis for much of his philosophy concerning sound. His work completely changed my perspective on what music can be. This man had dedicated himself to music that literally healed, bringing his musical salve to sick patients in hospitals and clinics. It was music with a practical application, not just a stylistic one. The model is similar in function to indigenous or ceremonial music&mdash;early, purpose-driven forms that are arguably the foundation for why we enjoy organized noise today.</p>

<title>I&#039;m Short, Not Stupid Presents: &#039;Life&#039;</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145086/I-m-short--50-Life.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 362px;" /></p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s strange, I only think about the big ideas when I&rsquo;m down in the dumps or high on some drug. I&#39;m never just eating pasta at dinner and thinking&nbsp;<em>what does it all mean?</em>&nbsp;If that was the case, it&rsquo;d be unbelievably exhausting to be alive. Everyone has a different definition of what &ldquo;life&rdquo; is and that&rsquo;s OK. You&#39;ve got your thing and I&#39;ve got mine. I like my life a lot, except when I don&rsquo;t. I usually think other people&rsquo;s shit sucks, except when it&rsquo;s amazing and I wish I had what they&#39;ve got.&nbsp;Even when you&#39;re feeling high and mighty, there&#39;s that lingering feeling that right around the corner could be that metaphorical kick in the pants.&nbsp;We&#39;ve all been there before. The person breaks your heart. You get fired for no reason.&nbsp;It&#39;s that moment that sends you to the ground cradling&nbsp;your bruised genitals, the moment where you&#39;re looking up at the clouds in the sky and you get a flicker or a notion of your life&#39;s purpose.&nbsp;But like everything else, it&#39;s fleeting. We are all stuck in an infinite loop of getting knocked down and picking ourselves back up. Few films have managed to capture that better than Rod&nbsp;Blackhurst&#39;s&nbsp;short called, you guessed it, &ldquo;Life.&rdquo; Kevin&nbsp;Heffernan&nbsp;(<em>Super Troopers</em>) stars as the person living it and it&rsquo;s rough. Check it out below and then read my little interview with the filmmaker to clear up any confusion about what this whole thing is about. (The film, not life itself.)</p>

<p>
	<strong>VICE: Is this short film autobiographical?<br />
	Rod Blackhurst: </strong>Sort of. Early last year, I option-ed a short story called <em>North</em> by a writer I like, Matthew Wade Jordan, and spent the first part of the year developing it into a feature film with&nbsp;my friends David Ebeltoft and Elgin James. Everything was looking good. We had some producers who wanted to finance the film, we&rsquo;d written a pretty good&nbsp;script, and we had a good cast lined up. And then, about a week before we were scheduled to start shooting, we figured out that the producers were jokers. Total&nbsp;ass clowns. So, we were forced to cancel our plans and hit reset on the project. It was really, really frustrating. I was pretty beat down about everything, and&nbsp;needed to go out and make something to break out of the funk. <em>Life</em> is what came out of that. As far as I can tell, trying to &ldquo;make it,&rdquo; or whatever, in the arts is&nbsp;like this dehumanizing slog. You get kicked in the nuts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You&#39;re a guy and we get the balls metaphor. But Rod, what&#39;s the version of this for the ladies?</strong><br />
	In the works. It&rsquo;s going to be called <em>Life 2</em>, and it&rsquo;s going to be more or less the same but it&rsquo;s going to be a woman running, and it&rsquo;s going to be dawn. Nice&nbsp;symmetries, I think. I have a call into Sandra Bullock about it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How many takes did it take to get the cinematography just right?</strong><br />
	It took seven takes to get things just right, which is good because we only had enough film for eight or nine takes. As for the ball kick, I&rsquo;m still not certain we got it exactly&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did Kevin Heffernan come on board?</strong><br />
	Kevin and I went to the same college years apart. We met a few years ago when my friend David Ebeltoft and I started talking to him about starring in <em>You Were Once Called Queen City</em>, which is a dark comedy about high school wrestling. Kevin was going to have a part in <em>North</em> and after things fell&nbsp;apart with that I asked him if he wanted to head out into the desert.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
	&nbsp;<br />
	<strong>What are you working on now? &nbsp;</strong><br />
	I just made a short with my friends Josh Murphy and Trevor Eiler called <em>PlanGOP</em>, about an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mYE33oUHuI" target="_blank">abortion pill Republicans can feel good about</a>. I&rsquo;m directing a feature documentary, which I&rsquo;m excited about. And I&#39;m working to find financing to make North and&nbsp;<em>You Were Once Called Queen City</em>. Grinding away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/prism-index-2" target="_blank">Jeffrey&nbsp;Bowers</a>&nbsp;is a tall mustached guy from Ohio who&#39;s seen too many weird movies.

<title>What Actually Happens to Donated Clothes?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/what-actually-happens-to-donated-clothes</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 22:26:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145107/CLOTHING-popup-copy.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 425px;" /></p>
<p>
	For Adam Baruchowitz, every t-shirt tells a story&mdash;whether or not he wants to hear it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;People want to explain to you every item, like &lsquo;this is the shirt I lost my virginity in,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the 41-year-old founder of <a href="http://wearablecollections.com/" style="font-size: 12px;">Wearable Collections</a>, a Brooklyn-based textile recycling company that retrieved more than 2 million pounds of synthetic rompers, snapback hats, and skinny jeans from New York dorm rooms, apartment buildings, and green markets last year. &ldquo;People have really close association with their clothing. But when the cycle is done, we&rsquo;re going to help give it another life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	That new life, like the life of most clothes &ldquo;donated&rdquo; in the United States, bears little resemblance to its previous owner&rsquo;s, nor what its previous owner&rsquo;s imagines. Of the roughly 2 million tons of used clothing Americans recycle each year, less than half is ever worn again: 30 percent is cut up for use as industrial rags, and another 20 percent is shredded for couch stuffing and home insulation. Those clothes that continue as clothes &mdash; some 860,000 tons valued at nearly $700 million a year, according to the Department of Commerce &mdash; are next worn in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Mombasa, Kenya.</p>
<p>
	All of which makes recyclers like Adam and his ilk a comfortable, if highly competitive living.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They always get villainized every time people find out they make a profit from what they do,&rdquo; Elizabeth Cline, journalist and author of the fast-fashion expose <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Overdressed-Shockingly-High-Cheap-Fashion/dp/1591844614"><em>Overdressed</em></a>, told me.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny little conundrum, because all recycling is for profit&mdash;as it should be. Otherwise, it probably wouldn&#39;t exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Unlike glass and aluminum recycling, which has only been in vogue for the past 40 years, the rag trade has been making American recyclers rich for more than a century. But a new crop of competitors&mdash;young upstarts like Adam and old-school scrappers like the Gromans of <a href="http://spingreen.com/">SpinGreen</a>&nbsp;in Sheepshead Bay, along with quasi-legal operations like New Jersey&rsquo;s omnipresent Viltex&mdash;are stirring up the schmatta business in New York City, where it ranks among the most cut-throat and least regulated industries around.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is one of the dirtiest businesses I&rsquo;ve ever seen,&rdquo; said recycler Eliot Groman, an ex-Soviet immigrant who sold the used cooking oil processing business he built with his wife Polina to get into the rag trade. &ldquo;People set fire to the bins, they climb into the bins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Other bins just vanish.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A bin is an ATM; it&rsquo;s like a reverse ATM,&rdquo; Adam said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s are reasons people drop these bins all around. They can be lifted with forklifts. It&rsquo;s very territorial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I asked Eliot which laws govern his year-old company and others like it. He scoffed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the Wild West,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one law that basically says that you have to put [collection bins] on private property, and that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Even that rule, Local Law 31, gets little respect. The City&rsquo;s Department of Sanitation was called to collect about 70 illegal bins since July 2012, and virtually none before that.</p>
<p>
	What makes the bins illegal is their wanton placement on public property, not their profit margins. But in New York, as in scores of municipalities across the country, the sudden realization that old clothes are being collected for industry rather than altruism is what has people up in arms.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A lot of people aren&rsquo;t aware that textile recycling exists or that 95 percent of clothing and textiles can be recycled,&rdquo; said Jackie King, executive director of the <a href="http://www.smartasn.org/">Secondary Materials and Recycled Textiles association</a>, which represents recyclers across North America and has recently begun fighting back against proposed bans. &ldquo;A ban on for-profit bins, that doesn&rsquo;t help the situation from a collection standpoint for keeping this material out of the landfill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Recycled textiles are still barely a drip compared to other consumer goods diverted from the waste stream: Americans recycle about 95 percent of batteries, 70 percent of newspapers and more than 50 percent of aluminum cans, yet, 85 percent of old clothes end up in the trash, a full 5 percent of the country&rsquo;s annual waste.</p>
<p>
	The reason, many say, is public perception.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Americans go around operating under the assumption that there are still all these poor underdressed people in America who desperately need our castoff clothing,&rdquo; when in reality, &ldquo;we are drowning in our own textile waste,&rdquo; Cline said. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t all possibly be reused here and it can&rsquo;t all continue on as clothing. People have to think about how much they&rsquo;re buying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She said the industry itself is often complicit in the problem.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;These companies are private and they&rsquo;re very secretive,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just this really old-school industry that doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of interaction with the public and it needs to be overhauled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The rag-traders agreed.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a very underground market,&rdquo; Adam said. &ldquo;They have these really strong operations going already, so they don&rsquo;t necessarily benefit from the higher profile of the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Although he and others are upfront about their for-profit status, many would-be donors are aghast to learn still where their goods are really going.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going into your closet and stealing your clothes,&rdquo; Adam said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We never were a not-for-profit, but the perception of this world is that it&rsquo;s nonprofit, and you&#39;re always giving to nonprofits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	That argument elides the fact that established thrift-store charities like Goodwill and Salvation Army retail only a tiny fraction of the donations they collect, selling 80 percent &ldquo;out the back door&rdquo; to recyclers. The Department of Sanitation&rsquo;s nascent textile recycling program has diverted castoff clothes to the charity Housing Works, but the nonprofit relies on industrial for-profit recyclers to dispose of the excess.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too expensive for them. The only way [municipalities like New York] can do it is for a private entity to do it,&rdquo; Eliot said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t pretend to be a charity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Like panty girdles and JNCO jeans, the donation model may simply have outlived its era.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Disposable clothing is a reality,&rdquo; Cline said. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t [collectors] just say, &lsquo;recycle your clothing here?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Can Corporations Find God? Supreme Court Justices Seem to Think So</title>

<p>
	The relentless litigation of Obamacare returned to the Supreme Court this week, when justices heard oral arguments in the controversial Hobby Lobby case. The case hinges on whether the Christian arts-and-crafts chain can refuse to offer its employees coverage for birth control, based on the grounds that it violates the religious beliefs of the company&#39;s devout Baptist owners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The arguments brought the culture war back to the courthouse steps this week, opening up a complex debate among the justices Tuesday about religious freedom, government regulation, and corporate rights. But the touchstone question is whether for-profit corporations have the right to exercise religion&mdash;something that the court has never ruled on before. Depending on where the nine justices come down on the questions, the ruling could have major ramifications far beyond the issues of contraception and Obamacare.</p>
<p>
	The case&mdash;which actually combines two suits, <em>Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</em> and <em>Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius</em>&mdash;itself is fairly straightforward. Under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration came up with a set of minimum requirements for health insurance plans, which includes coverage for a range of contraceptives. Hobby Lobby and its co-plaintiff, Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., a Pennsylvania-based cabinet manufacturer owned by devout Mennonites, say that they have no problem providing most forms of contraception, but that the government shouldn&rsquo;t force them to cover IUDs and emergency contraception like Plan B, which they regard as forms of abortion.</p>
<p>
	Hobby Lobby, the lead plaintiff, <a href="http://www.hobbylobbycase.com/the-case/">claims that it is protected by the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, which protects people from federal laws that pose a &ldquo;substantial burden&rdquo; to religious exercise. But the RFRA has never been applied to corporations, and the Obama administration argues that its protections don&rsquo;t extend to for-profit companies. &ldquo;It would be such a vast expansion of what Congress could have thought it was doing to say that for-profit corporations can make claims for religious exemptions to any laws of general application that they want to challenge,&rdquo; Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, who defended the law, told the court.</p>
<p>
	Judging by the <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-354_5436.pdf">transcript from Tuesday&rsquo;s oral arguments</a>, the justices weren&rsquo;t buying it. In fact, a majority of justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy, seemed onboard with the idea of corporate religiosity. Even Justice Stephen Breyer, who usually sides with the court&rsquo;s liberal judges, seemed open to considering the argument that companies should be allowed to bring RFRA claims to court. In a pretty convincing hypothetical, Justice Samuel Alito asked Verrilli what would happen if the government decided to ban kosher or halal butchers. &ldquo;They would have no recourse whatsoever,&rdquo; Alito said. &ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t get their day in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Still, a ruling in favor of for-profit religious freedom would signal a pretty major shift in the concept of corporate personhood, dramatically expanding on the 2010 <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> ruling that granted companies full rights to freedom of speech, including the right to make campaign donations. While <em>Citizens United</em> may have been a terrible ruling, the idea that corporations have a First Amendment right to free speech was grounded in decades of legal precedent. The idea that a company can have religious beliefs&mdash;and impose those religious beliefs on employees and customers&mdash;is totally new.</p>
<p>
	Such a decision could have some troubling consequences. Opponents of Hobby Lobby have imagined an array of slippery-slope catastrophes, warning that companies could use religious protection to skirt minimum wage and fair-housing laws, discriminate against customers and employees, and gain unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace. &ldquo;A bad&nbsp;<em>Hobby Lobby&nbsp;</em>decision will have an immediate negative impact on the right of a woman to make personal health care decisions,&rdquo; Center for American Progress president Neera Tanden said in a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/press/statement/2014/03/25/86389/statement-cap-president-neera-tanden-on-the-supreme-courts-oral-arguments-in-sebelius-v-hobby-lobby-stores-inc/">statement,</a> &ldquo;but it could also become a blueprint for discrimination against people in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community; allow corporations to evade important federal laws; and change the corporate structure as we know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	And perhaps the more pressing concern, raised by the Supreme Court&rsquo;s three female justices Tuesday, is that companies could claim to have religious objections to other health care services, like vaccines or blood transfusions. &ldquo;There are quite a number of medical treatments that different religious groups object to,&rdquo; Justice Elena Kagan said Tuesday. &ldquo;So one religious group could opt out of this, and another religious group could opt out of that, and everything would be piecemeal, and nothing would be uniform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It really opens up a Pandora&rsquo;s box, and it is going to be very difficult to contain it in any way,&rdquo; said James Cox, a professor of corporate law at Duke University. &ldquo;The very basis of corporate law is that you can create an entity that is separate and distinct from its owners. Once you start moving away from that and say that this entity is going to have the features of the people who own it, that opens up a whole vista and we don&#39;t know what the ramifications are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&quot;It&#39;s been roundly understood that a corporation lacks a soul&mdash;I think that&#39;s a pretty good metaphor for this,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>
	If the court decides that corporations can be religious, it could also be the death knell for the Obama administration&rsquo;s case. Under the RFRA, the Justice Department has to convince the court that the contraception mandate represents a compelling government interest&mdash;in this case, advancing women&rsquo;s health&mdash;and that the law is the &ldquo;least restrictive option&rdquo; for fulfilling that interest. Notably, while the lower courts have been divided on the question of whether corporations can be religious, they have <a href="http://www.becketfund.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/2013.06.27-Opinion.pdf">never ruled in favor of the DOJ on the RFRA question.</a></p>
<p>
	Where the government&rsquo;s case appeared to fall apart Tuesday was on the issue of the least restrictive option. Several justices pointed out that the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2012pres/01/20120120a.html">Obama administration has already granted exemptions</a> to the contraception mandate on religious grounds. Churches are totally exempt from providing birth control coverage; religious non-profits, such as schools and hospitals, can register an objection to contraception, and employees then receive contraception coverage from a third-party insurer. It follows that there actually is a way for the government to provide birth control coverage that is less restrictive of religious rights&mdash;it just doesn&rsquo;t want to extend that option to for-profit companies like Hobby Lobby.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not clear why the government made this distinction,&rdquo; said Douglas Laycock, a constitutional law professor at the University of Virginia. &ldquo;I think they took seriously the claim of religious non-profits, and they didn&#39;t take seriously the claim of the for-profit companies, and that was probably a mistake. It might have avoided all of this litigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But Laycock adds that concerns over the potential implications of a ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby are probably overblown, given the restrictions of the RFRA. &quot;It could have implications to the extent that other claims are analogous, but there are not many cases that are analogous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Proving that that the government has a compelling interest in a law is a balancing act, Laycock explained, one that depends both on the religious claim and whether there is another way for the government to provide a service. In the Hobby Lobby case, the sincerity of the religious opposition to abortion is uncontested. Meanwhile, the government already has another way of providing birth control coverage. But it could be hard for other companies to meet that burden. &ldquo;With LGBT rights, it would be hard to prove that it is a central tenant of someone&rsquo;s religion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And there is no other way for the government to protect people from discrimination except to protect people from discrimination.&rdquo;</p>

<title>A Few Impressions: Broadway, Baby</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/broadway-baby</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 20:27:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145088/image.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
	So you want to know what it&rsquo;s like to put up a play on Broadway? I&rsquo;ll tell ya. But, I should note, the way a classic play is put on (specifically John Steinbeck&rsquo;s <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, in which I am currently starring) is much different from the way a new one is produced.</p>
<p>
	With a new play the playwright will most likely be in rehearsals every day, looking over the director&rsquo;s shoulder and telling him or her how to manifest the story and themes through the bodies of actors and work of the designers. There are usually rewrites on the fly because new dynamics are found while putting the scenes on their feet. This forces the actors to learn new lines, often through many iterations, and sometimes the night before a performance. Essentially, when mounting a new play, the director is offered the luxury of having a partner by his or her side to help guide everything until it&rsquo;s just right.</p>
<p>
	With a classic play&mdash;especially if the writer is dead, like John Steinbeck is dead&mdash;it&rsquo;s the opposite. The words are holy; do NOT fug with them. In movies, depending on whom you&rsquo;re working with (i.e., not David Kelley or Aaron Sorkin) you can often mold the lines to fit your mouth a little better. The upside of this is that performances can be made more natural. The downside is that sometimes the nuances of great writing can be shaved off or dumbed down. Then you have movies like <em>This Is the End</em>, in which every scene involves at least a little improvisation and is often <em>entirely </em>improvised and much of the dialogue is &ldquo;written&rdquo; in front of the camera. Of course, this is an art in and of itself, and it can yield great results, but usually only with people like Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg who know how to guide such free-form methods into the proper channels of the story so that the overall spine of the film is preserved.</p>
<p>
	<em>Of Mice and Men</em> includes plenty of slang from the day (California rancher talk, circa 1937): tons of double negatives (&ldquo;not say nothing&rdquo;), and plenty of instances of &ldquo;bastards,&rdquo; &ldquo;sons of a bitches,&rdquo; &ldquo;goddamn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jesus!&rdquo; and &ldquo;hell,&rdquo; all of which resulted in the novella being banned from many schools when it came out. The successful play arrived soon after the novella, then the black-and-white film, making&nbsp;<em>Of Mice and Men</em>&nbsp;an early trifecta of entertainment-industry success. So, for an actor working on this material, there is an emphasis on learning the lines exactly as written, but often one struggles with trying to remember if at a specific moment a guy is called a son of a bitch or a bastard. (I know, I know, it&rsquo;s the poetry of the fields, the rhythms of the workingman.)</p>
<p>
	People who don&rsquo;t really understand acting might think that the biggest challenge when performing in a play is learning the lines. Although a solid grasp of the lines will help free the performer to deal with his circumstances and movement on stage, learning lines is also just part of the deal, like a musician in an orchestra learns sheet music. But the learning of the lines of a classic play&mdash;<em>verbatim, </em>as if the lines were holy&mdash;makes an actor approach a role in a completely different way from how he or she might tackle it otherwise. If a line doesn&rsquo;t make sense, or it sounds awkward coming out of your mouth, you can&rsquo;t change it. You need to find some way of making sense of it. (And if you really can&rsquo;t do that, just fake it and say it with conviction.)</p>
<p>
	As Chris O&rsquo;Dowd&mdash;who plays Lenny in our <em>Of Mice and Men</em> production&mdash;has said, if you think your character wouldn&rsquo;t say a certain line, <em>you&rsquo;re wrong.</em> Instead of building a character from the inside out as an enterprise separate from the script (understanding what makes him tick emotionally, how he sounds, what he moves like, etc.), one can look to the script for most of this; it&rsquo;s all in there. Many screenwriters might argue that their writing works the same way as that of playwright, but narratives in movies and television work differently, and often behavior, action, and silence are better. But on stage, the words rule and propel everything (at least in conventional Broadway productions; we&rsquo;re not talking about the Wooster Group or the Living Theatre, where the tyranny of the script is consciously overthrown). Behavior and action are important, of course, but they both grow from the text. Stage blocking and stagecraft is there to serve the delivery of the meaning of the words.</p>
<p>
	The thing about plays is that everything is worked on <em>beforehand,&nbsp;</em>meaning that on a film there is an editor, and even though the actors perform the scenes in front of the camera so that they have a rhythm, a filmmaker always knows that the tempo of the scene can be adjusted in post. In addition, films involve the framing of the camera shots, and in this way the attention of the audience is directed very closely. On a stage, the members of the audience can look wherever they please (although it is a stage director&rsquo;s job to narrow the focus of that attention through blocking, but that could be the subject of an entire article itself). This means that all the work that can be done in post&mdash;choosing shots, their order, size and duration&mdash;is done beforehand. The piece is designed as a whole, to be performed live, and thus, the rhythms and blocking must be worked out in advance.</p>
<p>
	In this modern age when there is little time for out-of-town tryouts (or at least in plays featuring movie stars who can&rsquo;t commit years to a production), there is typically a month of previews for Broadway shows. Before doing <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, I hadn&rsquo;t realized the importance of these previews. They are like test screenings for movies, except there&rsquo;s a paying audience. But hell, it makes sense, because even in a preview the performers are <em>live</em>, and that is one of the main things about the theater, as Walter Benjamin pointed out in the 1930s: As opposed to the performer on film, the live performer has an &ldquo;aura.&rdquo; So, almost regardless of the quality of the performance, there is already something about having the performers in front of an audience that distinguishes it from filmed performance. Ostensibly previews aren&rsquo;t judged, even though in this era of instant gratification and social media the word gets out pretty damn fast. Thank goodness we&rsquo;ve had standing ovations since our first preview.</p>

<title>The Insane Rage of College Basketball Coaches</title>

	<i>UNC coach Roy Williams showing displeasure at a game in 2007. Photo via Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kevin813/" target="_blank">kevin813</a></i></p>
<p>
	The NCAA basketball tournament isn&rsquo;t quite the &ldquo;One Shining Moment&rdquo; montage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbK535vSpaE" target="_blank">CBS would have you believe it is</a>, but as a television program you can watch that makes you feel stuff&mdash;happy, heartbroken, nervous as hell&mdash;it works about as well as any sporting event. The games have a squirrel-loose-in-the-dog-park franticness to them. Announcer <a href="http://theclassical.org/articles/bill-raftery-and-the-power-of-love" target="_blank">Bill Raftery</a> is there, ejaculating poetically. A bunch of teenagers from nowhere occasionally upset a bunch of teenagers from somewhere and do celebratory <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2014/03/24/canevaris-big-dance-why-we-love-his-nae-nae/" target="_blank">goofy-slash-gleeful dances</a>. You&rsquo;ve got an office pool going, and it turns out no one you work with knows anything about college basketball, but it also turns out no one really cares about not knowing. We are, nearly all of us, having a good time.</p>
<p>
	You know who&#39;s not having a good time? Rick Pitino, who&#39;s making a face best described as &ldquo;angry about the orgasm he&rsquo;s having.&rdquo; On Friday, with five and a half minutes left to go in the game, Pitino&rsquo;s Louisville team was beating Saint Louis by 13. It was pretty much over, but Pitino didn&rsquo;t give a shit about the score&mdash;he began berating junior guard Wayne Blackshear like an Olive Garden waiter who has picked the wrong fucking Thursday to serve him room-temperature grilled chicken Toscano, all because Blackshear had just turned the ball over, apparently for the sole purpose of infuriating his coach. Once Pitino finished with Blackshear, he went on to harangue the various Newtonian forces that caused his player to fumble the ball out of bounds. Inertia&rsquo;s playing with its head up its ass tonight.</p>
<p>
	That sort of scene is common enough that a casual viewer might wonder why all these old white guys are so pissed off all the time. College basketball coaches, as a general rule, could stand to tone it down. Their aggro flourishes are strange enough during relatively inconsequential mid-season rock fights, but the way their perma-peeved demeanors go to 11 during the tourney is particularly at odds with the giddy, carnivalesque atmosphere that pervades it. They are at a concert refusing to look up from the ground. They are at the zoo glaring at a giraffe. They are at the park and thinking about being at the office. They are with their wives and wishing they were dead. March Madness has a single sour note, and it&rsquo;s Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan&rsquo;s scowl.</p>
<p>
	The coaching profession is attractive to psychological Napoleons, the types of people who consider intimidation a management tactic. Some, like Bobby Knight&mdash;a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Qxu5cvW-ds" target="_blank">chair-tosser</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm3YFFjj5y8" target="_blank">player-choker</a>, a spitting lunatic&mdash;become beloved abusive paterfamiliases. In the myths sportscasters tell about them, their unchecked vindictiveness becomes part of what makes them great: <em>Knight once made Steve Alford strip naked while the rest of the team was ordered to pelt him with maple-syrup-filled water balloons. That day, Alford learned a valuable lesson about questioning authority.</em> Less skilled pricks, like former Rutgers coach Mike Rice&mdash;<a href="http://deadspin.com/heres-the-video-of-mike-rice-abusing-his-players-that-465911764" target="_blank">who struck his players</a> and called them faggots&mdash;are banished to the Crazy Asshole bin of history. The difference between these two fates comes down to little more than success. You have permission to be a bully, so long as you recruit well and make a few final fours.</p>
<p>
	It takes a special kind of jerk to act like Bob Knight all the time, but March Madness has a way of bringing out every coach&rsquo;s most virulent &quot;I am not fucking around&quot; tics. The result is a rainbow of dad rage. Florida&rsquo;s Billy Donovan becomes <a href="http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/gatorbytes/files/2012/02/97672102.jpg.23138_crop_650x4401.jpg" target="_blank">an aggrieved eagle</a>. Indiana&rsquo;s Tom Crean transforms into <a href="https://www.archetypes.com/sites/default/files/m02-1413-tom-crean.jpg" target="_blank">an anguished ham</a>. Syracuse&rsquo;s Jim Boeheim <a href="http://orangefizz.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/JimBoeheim1.jpg" target="_blank">flails his arms and whines</a>. North Carolina&rsquo;s Roy Williams does this thing where he&rsquo;s, like, <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FECmF_QmnKk/US-9STBwOWI/AAAAAAAAAME/XqYyruy2bSg/s1600/roy-intense.jpg" target="_blank">pooping into</a> an <a href="http://lonelytailgater.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/roy-williams.jpg" target="_blank">imaginary hole in the ground</a> and also <a href="http://wlusidelines.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/126359_crop_340x234.jpg" target="_blank">he&rsquo;s furious about it</a>. Kentucky&rsquo;s John Calipari <a href="http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Photo/_new/g-biz-100326-hmed.grid-6x2.jpg" target="_blank">makes himself big</a>, like a bear is approaching.</p>
<p>
	This is what happens when you put unfathomably competitive men in charge of powerless college kids during a tournament in which contract extensions and bonus money are up for grabs. (For the coaches, that is. The players get nothing&mdash;oh, sorry, they get an <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/unc-officials-admit-athletes-took-fake-classes-2014-1" target="_blank"><em>education</em></a>.) There are occasionally gross overtones of paternalism in this arrangement; coaches are like parents who don&rsquo;t fret about scarring their children in service of a greater good. They would tell you that greater good is making men out of boys, but pretty obviously their ultimate goal is beating Villanova.</p>
<p>
	Coaching is a peculiar job in that you&rsquo;re like a superhero whose signature power is planning. You run the practices, you pick the lineup, you set the substitution patterns, you call the plays, and yet, as is painfully apparent when your team blows three straight defensive assignments, there are times when none of this affects the contest you&rsquo;re hellbent on winning. You can&rsquo;t will your point guard to stop making dumb passes, so naturally you curse and have third-graderish full-body meltdowns. (Keep in mind, you have a gigantic ego and the self-control of a relapsing addict.) You scream at your players. You scream at the refs. You scream at the concept of imperfect basketball. You simply&mdash;fist pounding on the scorer&rsquo;s table&mdash;<em>will not accept</em>&nbsp;that your perfect game plan is being thwarted by some slapdick teenager who is unable to execute a proper half-court trap. Your life is a series of aneurysms.</p>
<p>
	All this animal fury should be deeply unpleasant. It probably is, for the players who are on the receiving end of it. James Naismith, who invented basketball, famously took pride in creating a game that, he thought, didn&rsquo;t require a coach. Mike Krzyzewski drill-sergeanting his team, then <a href="http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view8/20140317/5001734/coch-k-throwing-pen-o.gif" target="_blank">petulantly whipping a pen at a chair</a> for an assistant to pick up, makes a decent case for the long-dead Naismith being correct. But somehow, amid the spectacle of offenses careening like a shopping cart down an incline and Verne Lundquist chortling and the Harvard band making <a href="http://thecouchletes.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/k-bigpic.jpg" target="_blank">hilariously derpy excitement faces</a>, Coach Anger is not the ugly or terrifying thing it otherwise would be. Instead, these human monuments to fury come off as transparently silly. They are trying to micromanage the apocalypse with a clipboard and a temper, and of course they&rsquo;re failing.</p>
<p>
	The tourney is at its most enjoyable when the momentum of a game causes it to hop its rails. Players are losing their nerve and their shit and some are sprouting wings. Some until-now-anonymous sophomore with big balls&mdash;<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/basketball/blog/the_dagger/post/Ian-Eagle-shares-the-origin-story-of-Bill-Rafter?urn=ncaab,133366" target="_blank"><em>onions!</em></a>&mdash;is drunk on himself and has ditched the plan. Fuck the offense: He pulls up from 25 feet and lets fly. The arena inhales. In the background, one blinkered man is performing an unintentional comedy routine. He&rsquo;s beside himself, kneading his hands into his skull, and he doesn&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s obvious to everyone else: This is the best part.</p>

<title>Meet the Nieratkos: Twelve Things &#039;Noah&#039; Got Wrong</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/twelve-things-noah-got-wrong</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145048/DSC00258.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 515px;" /></p>
<p>
	As a Catholic school student for nine and half years and an altar boy for the first half of those years, I know a thing or two about the best-selling work of fiction known as the Bible. And just like most fans of <em>The Lord of The Rings</em>, <em>X-Men</em>, and other classic works of fantasy in the past, I was a bit concerned when I heard about Hollywood&rsquo;s adaption of the inspiring Bible story of Noah. Like any other adaptation, there&rsquo;s a million ways to fuck up that story and very few ways to get it right. Thankfully, most of my skepticism was put to rest when I learned that&nbsp;Darren Aronofsky&mdash;the director of the greatest, most spot-on portrayal of New Jersey in film (<em>The Wrestler</em>)&mdash;would be at the helm.</p>
<p>
	Over the past 18 months since my book, <em>Skinema</em>, was optioned to be made into a scripted TV show, I&rsquo;ve become friends with&nbsp;Darren&nbsp;through my producer/his fianc&eacute;e, Brandi Milbradt. They were kind enough to invite my wife and me to last night&rsquo;s NYC premiere of <em>Noah.</em>&nbsp;As a friend, I figured I should give Darren&nbsp;some press (since no one else is talking about it) and write my honest take on the film. But being a real friend means telling someone the hard truths when everyone else is blowing smoke up his ass. That said, I feel it&#39;s my duty to let Darren know exactly what he&rsquo;s gotten wrong with his new film.</p>
<p>
	So in honor of the 12 Commandments, I offer you 12 things that <em>Noah</em> got wrong.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145050/DSC00257.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>1.</strong> The biggest and most annoying flaw in the entire movie is that they never get to the part where Noah gets eaten by the whale. I hate when movies like <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>Noah</em> stretch a short tale of fiction into three movies. Are we not going to even see the whale until the third film? What the hell? I felt like such an asshole sitting in the theater in my &quot;Shamu Rules&quot; T-shirt waiting for a whale that never came.</p>
<p>
	<strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Five minutes in I&rsquo;m asking why Hannibal Lecter has long hair, how he is alive in this time line, and why he didn&#39;t eat Noah when he drugged him in the cave. I was confused for the entire rest of the movie.</p>
<p>
	<strong>3. </strong>For a movie based on the book of Genesis, they failed to seize the obvious opportunity to use any song by the British rock band Genesis or even one of Phil Collins&#39;s solo tracks. I mean, &quot;In Too Deep&quot; would be good but &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB_-_cZrrFA" target="_blank">Against All Odds</a>&quot; seems like such a no-brainer, and I&rsquo;m quite certain it&rsquo;s never been used in a movie before.</p>
<p>
	<strong>4. </strong>There was no singing. If <em>The&nbsp;Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em> has taught us anything, it&rsquo;s that all movies should start out with a 30-minute Led Zeppelin cover sung by dwarves so that if anyone is running late to the theater they don&rsquo;t have to risk a DUI to avoid missing anything.</p>
<p>
	<strong>5.</strong> I got into the premiere late, so I missed where the movie took place, but with that much rain I assumed it was Seattle. Darren, I can assure you, there are not two black-fronted parakeets in all of Seattle. Now or then. And to go back to my previous point, if the film is set in Seattle, how could they not use a Nirvana tune? Like the cover of &quot;Jesus Doesn&rsquo;t Want Me for a Sunbeam&quot;?</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145051/DSC00265.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>6. </strong><em>Noah</em> is barely over two hours long. At 139 minutes, it falls way below the 201-minute&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em>, which I was certain this would eclipse (especially if they got to the whale). My suggestion would have been to add some more singing (of which, as I mentioned, there was none).</p>
<p>
	<strong>7. </strong>Neither Russell Crowe or Jennifer Connelly has a nude scene. (For what it&#39;s worth, we do see Hermione Granger with bare shoulders, though.)</p>
<p>
	<strong>8. </strong>Sadly, for whatever reason, the role of God was not reprised by George Burns. I&rsquo;m assuming it was a budgetary issue. We never see or hear God, either. In my opinion I would have had voice-over actor James Earl Jones be the voice of God so we could all pretend the Force and Darth Vader truly do surround and penetrate us while binding the galaxy together.</p>
<p>
	<strong>9.</strong> Aside from the Watchers, there are no black guys in the movie. I&rsquo;m not sure if the story of Noah and the Whale takes place before or after Jesus&rsquo; time, but one thing we all know for a fact is that Jesus was black. So even if this story pre-dates Jesus, we should, in the words of Buggin&rsquo; Out from <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, &ldquo;Have some brothers up on the wall.&rdquo; If it were up to me, I&rsquo;d have an all-black cast. Sorry, Russell Crowe. You did a great job (and who isn&rsquo;t a <em>Romper Stomper</em> fan?), but I think Jerrod Carmichael would&rsquo;ve made a better Noah.</p>
<p>
	<strong>10. </strong>Although the pop culture homages were hilarious (like when Noah goes to touch Seth&rsquo;s glowing finger&nbsp;&agrave;&nbsp;la <em>E.T.&nbsp;</em>and when young Hermione gets her magic wand stabbed into her stomach), but I found them completely inappropriate for a religious film. Religion is no laughing matter.</p>
<p>
	<strong>11. </strong>Sorry to give away the ending, but in the final scene of the movie Noah eats grapes. Not berries, as referenced the entire film.</p>
<p>
	<strong>12. </strong>Finally, I would have made the dove that signifies the end of the flood a little cooler, and by cooler I mean a pterodactyl, one that shoots lasers from its eyes and eats baby girls and ultimately fights Godzilla.</p>

<title>The North Korean Haircut Mandate Is Totally on Brand</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/the-north-korean-haircut-mandate-is-totally-on-brand</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145078/KimJongUn.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 456px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photo via Flickr User <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54050720@N05/" target="_blank">petersnoopy</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	According to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/03/26/that_story_about_north_koreans_being_required_to_get_kim_jong_un_s_haircut.html">some tenuous reports</a>, Kim Jong-un issued a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-26747649">mandate</a>&nbsp;two weeks ago&nbsp;that all&nbsp;university students&nbsp;in North Korea&nbsp;must get <em>his</em> haircut, reinforcing that uniquely North Korean brand of oh-fuck-that&#39;s-creepy.</p>
<p>
	Savvy marketers know that the best brands tell complete, consistent stories in which every consumer touchpoint connects to the bigger brand story arc. In the case of North Korea, we&#39;re talking about a nation-brand, so this is a brand that has two different demographics: those within the country and those outside of it. Inside North Korea, the consumer is engaged with content reminding him that the nation is powerful and loving. Outside of North Korea, the reputation is of a country full of brainwashed, malnourished, abused people controlled by a petulant, spiteful, ineffective, and frequently embarrassing leadership. Forcing all adult men to share the same haircut as their dictator is an effective way to reinforce that image to both demographics.</p>
<p>
	Among brand strategists, the Kim family are regarded as visionaries. They know how to control a narrative.&nbsp;North Korea is a special place. As the last example of a cult-of-personality utopia, such as the Soviet Union brand under Stalin or China under Mao, the Kim family leaders are worshiped not just as heroes but as gods. Those in the marketing industry would refer to this as a &quot;controlled brand environment.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145082/KimIlSung.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Statue of Kim Il-sung. Photo via Flickr User <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roman-harak/" target="_blank">Roman Harek</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	This environment began with Kim Il-sung, who, after being installed by Soviet leadership at the close of the Korean War, consolidated his power with his core demographic by producing consistent content that stayed on-brand with the message, <em>Your leader is supreme and heavenly, and he is a master of all trades, and he loves you</em>. Some even came to believe that Kim Il-sung controlled the sun and the weather, which is a great example of an especially engaged active user base. At the same time, Kim Il-sung purged any brand detractors from within by force and then&mdash;and this part is brilliant marketing&mdash;blamed it on his competitors, the Americans. That&#39;s just masterful storytelling.</p>
<p>
	As a result of these efforts, this is a demo that is very engaged with the North Korea brand and the Kim family. The worshipful engagement remains extensive. In 2012, a 14-year-old girl <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90777/7859315.html">drowned</a>&nbsp;during her attempts to save a portrait of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il from a flood at her school. The North Korean people&#39;s brand of fervent worship extended to Kim Il-sung&#39;s son, Kim Jong-Il, when he assumed power and then again now, after his passing, to his heir, Kim Jong-un. What we know about Kim Jong-un is only what we infer from his actions. We know that, like his father, he&#39;s obsessed with basketball. We know that he loves missiles with nuclear capabilities just as much as his father did. And now with the apparent haircut mandate, we know he has a knack for branding like his grandfather.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/145087/NorthKoreanFashion.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photo via Flickr User <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roman-harak/" target="_blank">Roman Harek</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	North Korean fashion-policing is nothing new. Under Kim Jong-il, in 2005 the state media ran a five-part television special called <em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jan/12/broadcasting.koreanews">Let&rsquo;s Trim Our Hair in Accordance with the Socialist Lifestyle</a></em>&nbsp;(excellent title) that directed viewers to choose from one of a handful of conservative hairstyle options. The special was part of an overall campaign against Western fashion influence, particularly men with long hair, labeling them unhygienic anti-socialist fools and &ldquo;blind followers of bourgeois lifestyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Men are required to keep their hair no longer than two inches, although older men get a small exemption to allow for comb-overs.</p>
<p>
	Since science is something the Kim family can and will shape however they see fit, the special claimed that long hair harms &ldquo;human intelligence development&rdquo; because long hair takes oxygen away from nerves in the head. It didn&rsquo;t explain why women were allowed to grow long hair, leaving the viewer to conclude on their own that women are simply less developed, obviously.</p>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/craigbrown/3614229/Way-of-the-world.html">separate</a>&nbsp;but similarly themed special had a hidden-camera segment that caught violators of the rule, like a <em>To Catch a Predator</em> for haircut violations. The show even identified violators by name and address, exposing them to ridicule from peers, as a warning of what might happen if you didn&rsquo;t fall in line.</p>
<p>
	Not everyone is on board with Kim Jong-un&rsquo;s directive, however, making some North Korea brand loyalists into brand questioners. They say it looks dorky. They say the haircut looks like that of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/03/485_154092.html">Chinese smugglers</a>. Those consumers better think about getting their content to shut the fuck up if they like their personal brand being &quot;not living in a prison labor camp.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Women, however, are still free to choose from any one of the 14 state-sanctioned haircuts.</p>

<title>See Tomorrow’s Photography Tonight at the SVA Mentors Show</title>

	There is no way to write this article without it reading like a blow job for the photography department at New York&rsquo;s School of Visual Arts. But maybe the program deserves a little attention&mdash;because it awards more than a hundred BFAs in photography each year, some of the students are bound to be really good by sheer odds. A unique part of their curriculum is <a href="http://www.sva.edu/events/events-exhibitions/mentors-2014">The Mentors Program</a>, which pairs the department&rsquo;s 60 top students with professionals in the photography field. If this sounds a little Darwinistic, that&rsquo;s because it is. &ldquo;The students are chosen at the end of their third year based on their engagement in the program and their hard work,&quot; department chair Stephen Frailey told me. &ldquo;The number of students we accept fluctuates each year depending on the characteristics of the class, but all are eligible.&quot;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This year, I&rsquo;m proud to be the least famous person on the list of SVA Mentors, which includes people like <em>New York Times Magazine</em> photo editor Kathy Ryan, photographer Mary Ellen Mark, artist Laurie Simmons, and art dealer Yossi Milo. VICE has always supported young photographers, so it makes sense that two past VICE photo editors are on the list as well: Christian Storm and Ryan McGinley.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I was interested in what mentors and students had to say about the experience of working together this year, so here is a preview of some of the work that will be on display at&nbsp;SVA&#39;s Chelsea gallery&nbsp;tonight from 6 to 8 PM, with comments from both sides. The show runs through Saturday, April 5, 2014.</div>

	<div>
		&quot;Ryan is a gem. He is full of great ideas ranging from sneaking into the morgue to look at dead bodies to scoping out old landfills. He encouraged me to get my hands dirty with my work, literally.&quot; &mdash;Sepeed Emambakhsh</div>
</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&quot;Sepeed&#39;s spooky anarchic photographs document her journeys with mysterious hobo-ish men through abandoned American wastelands. The images feel like alluring crime scenes of a film-noir vagabond lifestyle.&quot; &mdash;Ryan McGinley, photographer</div>

<div>
	&quot;I was so nervous when I first met Elisabeth, but she was really nurturing and invested in mentoring me. She wasn&#39;t afraid to tell it like it is, and I really appreciated her keen editor&#39;s eye.&quot; &mdash;Janice Chung</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&quot;Janice was the perfect mentee. She is talented, and she has a good project, for which she has done both photographs and a video. We worked together to round off both and discussed how to best represent her work. She focused on her family, which in turn reflects on her Korean roots. I respected the fact that she worked hard and wanted to give her project her all. She is very polite and appreciative, initially quite shy, but with each visit our exchange became more open and interactive. In short, a real pleasure.&quot; &mdash;Elisabeth Biondi, curator/visuals editor</div>

			&quot;Working with Kathy was really great and truly an honor. We met every two weeks. In the beginning we reviewed my portfolio work of my mom and discussed how the work could thrive as editorial work. Later in our meetings we looked at other work I&#39;ve been making that I was hired to shoot. I would run ideas by her as far as my instillation for the Mentor Show, and we usually agreed on things. She&#39;s really open-minded and totally one of the nicest women ever. It was intimidating going to the <em>New York Times</em> building every two weeks.&quot; &mdash;<a href="http://www.mollymatalon.com/">Molly Matalon</a></div>
		<div>
			&nbsp;</div>
		<div>
			&quot;Molly brings an original and lively sense of warmth and wit to the portraits of her mother. She has a willing and cooperative subject, and that results in some revealing, provocative, and heartfelt pictures. It was a pleasure to watch this series evolve over the semester.&quot; &mdash;Kathy Ryan, director of photography, <em>New York Times Magazine</em></div>

			&quot;It was nice working with Simen. hH was friendly and helpful and gave me a bunch of materials that he didn&#39;t need anymore, including lots of glitter, a bunch of feathers, and what looked like a real chicken&#39;s head submerged in it all. Fun! I enjoyed seeing his workplace and having his input and advice on what I showed him.&quot; &mdash;<a href="http://laurenpoor.biz/">Lauren Poor</a></div>

				&quot;Paul is very generous with his time. It is obvious that he loves his job as an editor, curator, and mentor. He always made himself available and had a positive attitude. I&#39;m glad SVA provides us with this opportunity, and I could not have asked for a better mentor.&quot; &mdash;<a href="http://www.michaelanthonyimages.com/">Michael Schmidt</a></div>
			<div>
				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				&quot;Schmidt&#39;s work observing his estranged father is an exploration of the gap in a father-son relationship, which he approached with no expectations and depicted with detached curiosity. The work is at times awkward, funny, and deeply emotional.&quot; &mdash;Paul Moakley, deputy photo editor, <em>TIME</em></div>

				&quot;I have been a mentor with the School of Visual Arts for a number of years now, and without a doubt I would say that Tim has been my most conscientious mentee. He was very receptive to suggestions regarding his work.

					&quot;Working with Christian was rather insightful. He understood the point I was trying to make with my work and steered me away from doing some of the things that he had felt were a gimmick or cop-out, especially with the type of work I do. I feel that his words and guidance solidified what I was trying to accomplish with my latest project as well as what is in the show, so I&#39;m really grateful for working with him.&quot; &mdash;<a href="http://taperednape.tumblr.com/">Mateusz Silwa</a></div>

					&quot;Mat&#39;s work documents and examines the vernacular detritus of city living, looking for threads of color, shape, and gesture that suggest a hazy narrative for the viewer. Mat&#39;s a kind of photographer&#39;s photographer; he thinks visually and sees photographs everywhere, creating really clever, striking images from things you wouldn&#39;t guess. He is smart as hell and working with him was great, partly because we think about photography very similarly, which is always fun.&quot; &mdash;Christian Storm, photo editor</div>

I am so glad to have been paired with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.shoheimiyachi.com/">Shohei Miyachi,</a>&nbsp;a 24-year-old photographer from Shizuoka, Japan. He is one of the most deliberate artists I have ever met, but his work reveals a daring undercurrent. In his series <em>Devotion</em>, he photographs himself with an older gay man he met on the street one day, though he is not gay himself. They are both nude in the photographs, and the relationship visibly rises from struggle to fantasy, then deteriorates to the point of detachment. It&rsquo;s a provocative exchange: Shohei is allowed to make photographs of this man, and the man is allowed to adore Shohei.&nbsp;</div>

<title>Here Be Dragons: There&#039;s No Such Thing as &#039;Selfie Addiction&#039;</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144969/mrpimpgoodgame-quilt-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 431px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Mr. Pimp Goodgame, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/mrpimpgoodgame-has-mastered-the-second-dimension" target="_blank">king of the Instagram selfie</a></em></p>
<p>
	Recently, the assembled hacks at the<em> Sunday Mirror</em>&rsquo;s headquarters were deciding how best to cover the story of Danny Bowman, a teenager diagnosed with &quot;selfie addiction.&quot; Taking the sensitive, appropriate route, the British tabloid sent a photographer to <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/selfie-addict-took-two-hundred-3273819" target="_blank">take lots and lots of photos of him</a>.</p>
<p>
	Selfies are the latest trend in popular art&mdash;the cave paintings of the Age of Aquarius, only much less inspiring than anything our ancient ancestors ever produced. They combine two of the most potent forces in the modern world&mdash;computer technology and celebrity-fueled narcissism&mdash;to create a form of expression so powerful that <a href="http://www.closeronline.co.uk/2014/03/why-people-are-missing-the-point-of-the-no-makeup-selfie-trend-on-facebook" target="_blank">it can literally cure cancer</a>.</p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, with great power comes great danger, as anyone who&rsquo;s watched the popular New Zealand hiking documentary <em>Lord of the Rings</em> will remember. In it, a ring becomes so powerful that a small man is forced to walk a very long way for reasons that are never made entirely clear before throwing the offending piece of jewellery into a volcano. Someone else becomes so corrupted by the ring&#39;s power that he starts talking to himself, loses all his friends, and ends up developing a pretty nasty skin condition from the stress of it all.</p>
<p>
	But is it possible to be addicted to taking selfies, the way you can be addicted to alcohol or nicotine or the One Ring? The case of Danny Bowman is certainly extreme. According to the<em> Sunday Mirror</em> article, &quot;He dropped out of school, didn&rsquo;t leave his house in six months, lost two stone [28 pounds] trying to make himself look better for the camera, and became aggressive with his parents when they tried to stop him. Finally, in a drastic attempt to escape his obsession, Danny took an overdose&mdash;but was saved by his mum, Penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The article goes on to say that Bowman was treated for &ldquo;his technology addiction, OCD and body dysmorphic disorder,&rdquo; and breathlessly reports that &ldquo;the top psychiatrist [Dr. David Veale] at the clinic where Danny was treated revealed &shy;addiction to taking selfies is becoming so widespread it is now a recognized mental illness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Recognized by whom? That isn&rsquo;t said, and it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that &quot;selfie addiction&quot; doesn&rsquo;t appear to be recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), or any other diagnostic manual.</p>
<p>
	In fact, neither is &quot;technology addiction&quot; or &quot;internet addiction.&quot; That isn&rsquo;t to say that the symptoms suffered by people like Bowman aren&rsquo;t very real and debilitating, but they can generally be explained as signs of an underlying condition, rather than a condition in their own right. There&rsquo;s no need to invoke a whole new addiction to selfies to explain the behavior of someone with OCD and body dysmorphia.</p>
<p>
	The truth is, internet addiction isn&rsquo;t in the DSM because there&rsquo;s no good evidence that it exists as a condition in its own right. <a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/cpb.2008.0102" target="_blank">A meta-analysis</a> of ten years&rsquo; worth of studies published in 2009 highlighted some of the problems with research claiming to find evidence of it, which sounds eerily familiar to anyone who&#39;s studied similar attempts to find, say, the harm caused by pornography.</p>
<p>
	In the words of the authors, &ldquo;The analysis showed that previous studies have utilized inconsistent criteria to define internet addicts, applied recruiting methods that may cause serious sampling bias, and examined data using primarily exploratory rather than confirmatory data analysis techniques to investigate the degree of association rather than causal relationships among variables.&quot;</p>
<p>
	In other words, researchers were so focused on trying to prove that the condition existed that they couldn&rsquo;t come up with a coherent, standard description of what exactly the symptoms were. The authors of the meta-analysis &ldquo;found that prior studies on internet addiction have focused on &#39;proving&#39; the existence of internet addiction or identifying the characteristics of internet addicts,&rdquo; rather than doing the kind of rigorous analysis needed to rule out the possibility that these were just symptoms of other conditions.</p>
<p>
	Again, this isn&rsquo;t to say that there aren&rsquo;t instances where internet usage and mental health issues combine in a toxic way. Studies <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/climate_desk/2014/02/internet_troll_personality_study_machiavellianism_narcissism_psychopathy.html]" target="_blank">have increasingly shown links</a> between internet trolling and personality disorders, for example, and I&rsquo;ve spoken to several mental health workers in recent years who claim that groups of patients have joined forums to discuss ways to &quot;beat&quot; their therapists. The point here is that the underlying issue is the same, regardless of what technology is used&mdash;as those who checked into mental hospitals for &quot;<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3165546.stm" target="_blank">texting addiction</a>&quot; in the early 2000s will attest to.</p>
<p>
	A big problem not mentioned in the research, but noticeable in cases like Bowman&rsquo;s, is that often these cases are being reported by private doctors who make money from treating the conditions they describe. Even if they have the best intentions in the world, Veale and his peers aren&rsquo;t exactly unbiased observers.</p>
<p>
	Let&rsquo;s be diplomatic, though, and assume that the promotion of terms like &quot;selfie addiction&quot; isn&rsquo;t about profit. Could it be a useful way of getting stories about mental health into the media and raising awareness? Well, not if the comments under these stories are any indication. Of course, most people who leave comments on articles are cretinous morons, but some of the stuff posted on the coverage of Bowman&rsquo;s case is particularly cruel, even by the standards of the internet&#39;s bottom feeders.</p>
<p>
	One <em>Huffington Post</em> reader offered Bowman life-changing medical advice: &ldquo;Nothing a few firm slaps in the back of the head won&#39;t fix.&rdquo; For other armchair psychologists, this is just another generational problem: &ldquo;SELFIE ADDICTION. Really? How about we just admit that there are a lot of younger, lazier people who are incredibly egotistical that they need to make everything about themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So well done on the whole &quot;raising awareness&quot; thing, guys. Sure, comments aren&rsquo;t the best indication of the impact of a story, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling that giving faddish names to serious conditions isn&rsquo;t the best way to get people to take them seriously.</p>

<title>Eating Is Bad for Your Soul</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144993/jain-meditation.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Jains meditating. Photo via <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Jain_meditation.jpg" target="_blank">Wiki Commons</a></i></p>
<p class="p1">
	In prehistoric times, humans had to hunt for dinner with big rocks&mdash;or run away from it when it didn&rsquo;t die off&mdash;if they wanted to survive another day. Fast-forward to the modern universe, and we&rsquo;re almost effortlessly sourcing meals thanks to the aid of technology, from microwaves to ovens and refrigerators that fuel our gluttonous lives. But despite the world of <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-male-chef-is-food-porns-worst-nightmare"><span class="s2">#foodporn on Instagram</span></a> and food bloggers who like to showboat the latest food trends, there are many global communities of great gustatory self-restraint with strict dietary disciplines.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	Whether it&rsquo;s because of political or ethical motivations, a concern over health and longevity, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/28/breatharian-barbie-valeria-lukyanova_n_4873706.html"><span class="s1">some highly questionable sanity</span></a>, an <a href="http://www.vice.com/vice-on-hbo-outtakes/the-fat-farms-of-mauritania"><span class="s2">eating disorder</span></a>, or the <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-unbearable-neurosis-of-the-modern-eater"><span class="s1">neurotic habits of the modern eater</span></a>, humans&mdash;myself included&mdash;are notorious for self-imposing restrictions on what we put into our bodies. But one of the most notable motivations for food restrictions stems from religious beliefs.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Piety is all up in our food in terms of influence, with nearly <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/"><span class="s1">84 percent of the global population practicing some sort of religion</span></a> whose principal texts <a href="http://eatocracy.cnn.com/2010/07/20/clarified-religious-dietary-restrictions/"><span class="s1">instruct dietary restriction</span></a>. Aside from the degree to which these restrictions are followed or still seen as relevant, most religions of the world banish certain foods. The looser side of nutritional rules falls into the range of Christianity and Mormonism, while Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism come with tighter sanctions.</p>
<p class="p1">
	But while keeping kosher, halal, or vegetarian may sound over-the-top to some, there is one particular religion that surpasses all the others in the art of saying &quot;hell no&quot; to deliciousness. Known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"><span class="s2">Jainism</span></a>, it&rsquo;s a faith so extreme in its dietary restrictions that it makes all the primary global religions&mdash;even those with the strictest of dietary rules&mdash;look like a culinary free-for-all.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	Jainism is one of the oldest and most <a href="http://www.jainheritagecentres.com/Jainism/Ascetics/index.htm"><span class="s1">ascetically extreme</span></a> India-based religions in the world, with a current practicing population of about 5 million people. The name itself comes from the Sanskrit word <i>Jin, </i>meaning to conquer, and speaks to the Jains&rsquo; continual struggle to conquer all bodily needs, sensations, and worldly attachments, which eventually results in <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387852/moksha"><span class="s2"><i>moksha</i></span></a> (enlightenment) if you stick to the plan. Moksha breaks them out of the cycle of rebirth so that they don&rsquo;t have to keep getting reborn over and over again into this shitty world. Jain philosophy also stresses the importance of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/ahimsa_1.shtml"><span class="s2"><i>ahimsa</i></span></a>, or non-violence, to all living, karmic beings, in order to achieve moksha. But Jains believe that everything is a karmic being&mdash;essentially having a soul or whatever. This <a href="http://www.digambarjainonline.com/know/article2.htm"><span class="s2">includes</span></a> bugs, plants, root vegetables, and microorganisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144995/jainism-food-chart.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 845px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Jain hierarchy of beings via </i><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hierarchy_of_Beings.jpg"><span class="s2"><i>Wiki Commons</i></span></a></p>
<p class="p2">
	So when you mix a combination of extreme asceticism, extreme non-violence, and an all-inclusive karmic cycle that even maggots get to be a part of, it results in the world&rsquo;s most intense diet ever.</p>
<p class="p1">
	This means no meat, no fish, no eggs, no garlic or onions or any other root vegetables, no honey (which is seen as violence against bees), no alcohol, no fermented foods (it&rsquo;s violent against microorganisms), no unfiltered water (it may have small organisms in it), no mushrooms, no fungus, and no yeast.</p>
<p class="p1">
	For stricter Jainism, there is the additional restriction of avoiding food consumption at night. And consuming any food that has been left out overnight is a no-no because this is violence against microorganisms or small bugs that may now be hanging out in the leftovers. Don&rsquo;t even think about trying to look at the dairy group.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144997/jainism-fast.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 737px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p class="p1">
	Jain eating habits read as an exercise in saying no<i>, </i>because eating anything on the &ldquo;do not eat&rdquo; list equals negative karmic points. Besides the basic items that Jains are allowed to eat, their diet is made even more extreme by limiting themselves to eating only enough food to sustain human life, as well as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_in_Jainism"><span class="s2">30-plus</span></a> types of partial and total fasting&mdash;from <a href="http://jainsquare.com/2011/08/25/importance-of-fasting-during-paryushan/"><span class="s2">the eight-day</span></a> to the <a href="http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-jain-sadhu-s-180-day-fasting-to-be-celebrated-1964119"><span class="s1">180-day</span></a> fast&mdash;which act as a killer cleanse for your soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	But the most extreme part of all Jain religious dietary restriction is the practice of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallekhana"><span class="s2"><i>santhara</i></span></a>, a religious vow of voluntary death by fasting.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	Currently undertaken by an estimated <a href="http://expressindia.indianexpress.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=74730"><span class="s2">200 Jains per year</span></a>&mdash;typically by the elderly, ill, or those who have surpassed worldly attachment&mdash;this fatal fasting is seen as a blessed approach to purifying the body. The effort is undertaken to purge negative karma and achieve moksha. With their prolonged death&mdash;a product of complete fasting from all food and water&mdash;the individual has ample time to meditate, release all physical and emotional attachment, and come to death in a peaceful manner while being surrounded by <span class="s1"><a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/taboo/videos/fasting-to-death/">fellow Jains who chant and sing over them.</a></span></p>
<p class="p1">
	Recently, there has been a debate about whether santhara should be considered suicide or a form of euthanasia, both of which are illegal in India. But <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Is-santhara-against-the-law/articleshow/5704783.cms"><span class="s1">talks of making this practice illegal</span></a> continue to be challenged as an unconstitutional violation of religious freedoms by Jains. It seems that, <a href="http://www.littleindia.com/life/7730-freedom-to-die.html"><span class="s2">for now</span></a>, the right to santhara&mdash;and an almost martyr-like death&mdash;is legally protected, which means that microorganisms and maggots are safe from consumption, at least within the Jain community.</p>

<title>VICE Loves Magnum: How Photographer David Hurn Captures Sublime Moments in Mundane Life</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/david-hurn-photographs-sublime-moments-in-mundane-life</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 16:40:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144691/LON27707.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 440px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Arizona, 1980. An outdoor fitness group in the retirement community of Sun City does exercises early in the morning. The oldest participant was a 94-year-old who had run a 50-second hundred meters in the Senior Olympics.</em></p>
<p>
	After stumbling into photojournalism in the 50s, David Hurn acheived fame by photographing the Beatles and other pop-culture icons of the 60s. The British photographer also made much of the original artwork for <em>Barbarella </em>and the James Bond films, and shot fashion for publications like <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar</em>. But that stuff was just a day job that allowed him to pursue his true passion&mdash;photographing sublime moments in mundane life.</p>
<p>
	I recently talked to Hurn about wedding photography, colonoscopies, and the importance of not getting &quot;mystical&quot; about taking pictures of stuff.<br />
	<br />
	<strong>VICE: Compared with a lot of photographers, the type of work you&#39;ve done through your career varies hugely: You&#39;ve gone from war photography to documenting the pop stars of the 60s to documentary work and street photography. Did you consciously set out to try new things?<br />
	David Hurn: </strong>It wasn&rsquo;t that I wanted to try something new every now and then. When I started, in the mid 50s, there weren&rsquo;t galleries or anything like that. If you were involved in photography you were either a wedding photographer, a science photographer, or you were involved in that word <em>journalism</em>. So that&rsquo;s what we all did. I wanted to be a vet, or an archaeologist, but I had no qualifications at all. I was in the army doing national service when I first picked up a camera, and realized I quite enjoyed it. I was a shy person and photography&rsquo;s rather good for shy people; you hide behind something and have an excuse to be somewhere. If someone asks what you are doing, rather than crumpling and jabbering insanely, you say, &quot;Oh, I am a photographer.&quot;<br />
	<br />
	<strong>So when did it get serious?</strong><br />
	I had one of those moments that change one&rsquo;s life: I saw a photo in a copy of <em>Picture Post</em>. In the army we were led to believe that all Russians ate their children, but I saw this photo of a Russian army officer buying his wife a hat in a department store. And I started to cry. It moved me immensely. My father had been away during the war, and when he came back the first thing he did was take my mother to Howells [a department store] in Cardiff and buy her a hat. Suddenly I realized that I believed much more in the photo than I did in any propaganda. I realized that photography really can move people, just by being accurate.</p>
<p>

	<em>Budapest, Hungary, 1956. In a lull between fighting, life goes on.</em></p>
<p>
	<strong>How did that moment transform itself into a career?</strong><br />
	I decided there and then that was what I wanted to do. I left the army. It was the mid 50s, and the Hungarian revolution was starting. My instinct was that if I went there I would have something to photograph. So the initial work I did, which I suppose you would say was to do with violence, was simply done because it seemed a good entry to something I knew very little about.</p>
<p>
	Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t like it very much. Being shot at has never been my idea of a holiday experience. I got lucky, met some <em>LIFE </em>magazine reporters and followed them. I got some photos published in <em>LIFE</em> and distributed to <em>Picture Post</em> and the<em> Observer</em>. I learned very early that it&rsquo;s better to start at the top than the bottom. From the top, you can cling on desperately&mdash;if you start at the bottom, it&rsquo;s a long climb.</p>
<p>
	<strong>So your start in photography was in conflict reportage, but you quickly left that behind&mdash;is that right?</strong><br />
	The reality was that I knew it wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted to do. Partly because around me were people like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_McCullin" target="_blank">Don McCullin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Jones_Griffiths" target="_blank">Philip Jones Griffiths</a>, <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/ian-berry-magnum-interview-sharpeville-massacre" target="_blank">Ian Berry</a>, and all of them, and they were far more interested in the political aspect than I was. So I had to find my niche. I started to work for, primarily, American magazines. I wasn&rsquo;t making any money and by chance got into that rather actor-y, arts-y world. I met an actor named Richard Johnson, photographed him in &lsquo;6&#39;68 or something, which led to me covering a film, where I met a publicist&hellip; It&rsquo;s all this sort of networking thing. The publicist got me to work with him on big films. But all of these things were very peripheral to my life. I did the original posters for the Bond films and most of the iconic stuff for <em>Barbarella</em>, and most of the original stuff for the Beatles&rsquo; films. But they were all things that were done because it was necessary in order to do what I really wanted to do, which was observe the world.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Commercial work was a means to an end, then?</strong><br />
	Yes, absolutely. In 1970, when I came back to Wales I then virtually never took an assignment again. I worked on my own projects. That&rsquo;s not to say that if a magazine wanted to pay for work I was doing I would say no. But there is a difference.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Do you think that too many photographers aren&rsquo;t as open-minded and malleable as that? That they are unwilling to do commercial work or see it as conflicting with their ideals?</strong><br />
	I think it&rsquo;s one of the bad things that happens during university or a college education. A lot of the people who teach photography have a very mystical idea of what photography should be. They don&rsquo;t tell the students that the first thing to do as a photographer is not die of malnutrition. If you do, you aren&rsquo;t going to shoot many pictures. Part of the trick is [finding a balance] between doing what you want and making a living. If someone wants you, early in your career, to shoot a wedding, you should go and shoot the wedding. You can learn a lot from shooting a wedding. You work to a script. You need a picture of the bride and groom. It&rsquo;s no good shooting a bunch of flowers and saying, &quot;These flowers are lovely, they give me the feeling of spring,&quot; or something&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t work. You learn from doing <em>anything</em> well, whether it&#39;s what you want to do or not. Stay alive, concentrate on learning, and when you get the chance to do what you want, you will have the [skill] to do it well. Photography is basically a job. Like any job, you have to understand it&mdash;the context, the audience.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Do you there&#39;s a level of pretentiousness around photography?</strong><br />
	There&rsquo;s an incredible amount of it about certain types of photography. We hear that if there&rsquo;s a fire in a house, the first thing people grab is not the Cartier-Bresson on the wall&mdash;it&#39;s the wedding album. I think that should be discussed more. What it means is that something as simple as a wedding photo is incredibly important to people. If you are going to shoot a wedding, shoot it well. It&rsquo;s an honorable thing to do&mdash;in many ways far more important than somebody taking photos without even observing anything. Photography is about <em>observing</em>. The world is wonderful, go and record it&mdash;record what you find wonderful and hope that someone else is going to like it. And maybe hope that the person who likes it likes it enough to pay you for it.</p>

<p>
	<strong>That&rsquo;s the other side of your work, and really the main part of your life&rsquo;s work, it seems: Observing everyday life, mostly in small towns, be it in Arizona or Wales. Whithout sounding rude, is it about &quot;small towns,&quot; normality, maybe even banality?</strong><br />
	I once wrote something: &quot;Life, as it unfolds in front of the camera, is full of such complexity, such wonder, such surprise, that I find it unnecessary to create new realities.&quot; Now, that&rsquo;s rather pompous. But what I meant is it&rsquo;s more pleasure for me to record things as they are. I always wanted to be a recorder of life as I see it. When I came back to Wales I was fascinated by the word <em>culture</em>. I didn&rsquo;t really know what people meant by it. But I decided that if I went around Wales, and maybe made some books&mdash;one on the places people live, one on the way people live, one on the landscape they live in, and so on&mdash;then maybe I could eventually come to understand what that culture is. And that&rsquo;s basically what I do. I enjoy photographing the mundane.</p>
<p>
	<strong>And that&#39;s the work you continue to do today?</strong><br />
	I am 80 now, and I tend to be very tenacious, so when I sat down and realized I was getting older, slower, I thought: <em>What can I do that will last me another ten years of working?</em> I was luckily reading a John Updike book, which I enjoyed, and there was a quote in there: &quot;Giving the mundane its beautiful due.&quot; I love that.</p>
<p>
	I decided then that one of the major projects I would do is photograph my village. That&rsquo;s what I do now. It&#39;s so interesting&mdash;you go to the Women&rsquo;s Book Society and see eight women discussing a book they have read. I find it incredibly interesting but incredibly difficult, too. It&rsquo;s very mundane. And if you aren&rsquo;t careful you start to play tricks to overcome that, with a new lens, or Photoshop, or whatever, but actually what you have to do is end up with photos that are basically boring&mdash;where the only interest comes from small details and gestures.</p>
<p>

	<em>Llandovery, Wales, 1996. Churchyard maintenance. </em></p>
<p>
	<strong>So that&rsquo;s what interests you&mdash;normality?</strong><br />
	What I am interested in? I don&rsquo;t really care in a way. You can be a wedding photographer, a war photographer, or someone who calls themselves an &quot;artist&quot;&mdash;though nothing flabbergasts me more, whenever you ask someone what they mean by &quot;artist,&quot; they take it as an attack. But if you called yourself a &quot;plumber,&quot; I know what you mean. If they want to be an artist, fine.</p>
<p>
	The point is that, for me, anything is interesting as long as it&rsquo;s done well. I mean, if you want a hierarchy of importance then the most important picture in most people&rsquo;s lives is often taken by a camera up their arse. You can&rsquo;t get more down to earth than that. If you want a hierarchy, then colonoscopy or radiography is probably the most important photography there is. The rest is pretty mundane in comparison&mdash;but that&rsquo;s also not what it&rsquo;s about. It is about a person trying to show someone else what they are personally interested in, in a way that the viewer might not have seen it. Take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weegee" target="_blank">Weegee&rsquo;s</a> photos&mdash;I love them. I don&rsquo;t want to be a press photographer, but I see those photos and I just marvel that somebody with a box with a hole in the front could do what he did.</p>

<title>Why Is the Secret Service So Drunk All the Time?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/obamas-secret-service-cant-get-its-shit-together</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144766/ss-full.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 400px;" /></p>

	<i>Some Secret Service agents in uniform who are not drunk. Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdfriendofhillary/" target="_blank">Edward Kimmel</a></i></p>
<p>
	Among the many indignities visited upon America&rsquo;s first black president, we can now add one more: His Secret Service agents insist on raging.</p>
<p>
	The <em>Washington Post </em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/secret-service-agents-on-obama-detail-sent-home-from-netherlands-after-night-of-drinking/2014/03/26/86d1a8a6-b4e6-11e3-8020-b2d790b3c9e1_story.html?clsrd" target="_blank">reported</a> late on Tuesday that three agents deployed to the Netherlands ahead of Barack Obama&rsquo;s visit this week were sent home for drinking after one of them was discovered passed out on the floor of a hotel hallway. That frattish behavior apparently took place early Sunday morning, or about 24 hours before the president was scheduled to arrive. What&#39;s worse, these <em>Police Academy</em>&ndash;fodder drunks were members of the elite Counter Assault Team (CAT), which is responsible for beating back armed attackers if and when Obama&#39;s personal security detail is compelled to whisk him away to safety.</p>
<p>
	This isn&#39;t even the first time the Secret Service has been caught not-so-secretly getting fucked up. Back in April 2012, 11 agents deployed to Cartagena, Colombia, ahead of an Obama visit were <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/secret-service-agents-busted-refused-pay-hooker-source-article-1.1061657" target="_blank">sent home for hiring prostitutes</a>&mdash;and one of the agents wouldn&#39;t even pay his. Oh, and in 2011, Daniel Valencia, an agent assigned to go to Iowa ahead of an official visit, was <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/17/daniel-valencia-secret-service-agent-arrested-dui_n_929570.html">arrested</a> for drunk driving. Last December, Ignacio Zamora Jr., a supervisor in charge of the president&#39;s detail&mdash;the most prized assignent in the professional security world&mdash;was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/two-secret-service-supervisors-cut-from-obamas-detail-after-alleged-misconduct/2013/11/13/c736638c-48a8-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html" target="_blank">discovered</a> trying to force his way into a woman&#39;s hotel room, supposedly in hopes of retrieving a stray bullet he had left behind during some kind of liason that, I guess, involved him getting his gun (among other things) out.</p>
<p>
	So what gives? Why are so many Secret Service agents embarrassing themselves lately?</p>
<p>
	&quot;The Secret Service&#39;s main cultural problem has never been sexism or hypermasculinity. It&#39;s alcoholism,&quot; Marc Ambinder, a journalist who has <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/03/inside-the-secret-service/308390/" target="_blank">written extensively</a> about the inner workings of the agency, told me. This is nothing new: Tales of agents getting too drunk to perform their jobs date to at least the <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=9336799" target="_blank">Kennedy years</a>&mdash;there&#39;s even a conspiracy theory that an inexperienced&nbsp;trainee who was on AR-15 duty because other agents were too hungover to work <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Shooting_holes_in_theory_that_a_Secret_Service_agent_killed_President_Kennedy.html" target="_blank">accidentally killed JFK</a>.</p>
<p>
	These public humiliations have been more common recently, however. Several experts I spoke to attributed this series of mini-scandals during the Obama administration to a leadership vacuum left by the promotion of rank-and-file agents to senior positions instead of filling those posts with people from the military or other law enforcement agencies, as was common in the past. So while after-hours excesses aren&#39;t exactly novel, they&#39;ve been exacerbated by managers who are nearly as intent on protecting the Secret Service brand (and pleasing the White House staff) as guarding the president.</p>
<p>
	Case in point is the agency&#39;s decision to send the three boozing agents home, a clear overreaction according to Dan Emmett, a 21-year veteran of the agency and author of the upcoming memoir <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Within-Arms-Length-Extraordinary-Special/dp/1462070728" target="_blank">Within Arm&#39;s Length</a>. </em>&quot;Sending them home 24 hours before presidential arrival is counterproductive to the mission,&quot; he told me. &quot;When you take three CAT agents out of a team, you just decimated that team by 50 percent, thus rendering them ineffective.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Clearly the agency decided to get out in front of this latest PR disaster right away&mdash;it didn&#39;t want to make the mistake it made after the Colombia incident, when it declined to comment or act even as Ronald Kessler, a veteran journalist and author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/In-Presidents-Secret-Service-Protect/dp/030746136X" target="_blank">In the President&#39;s Secret Service</a></em>, was bringing it to light. Kessler told me that the agency&#39;s culture has been corrupted&mdash;which, he said, has led to a number of embarrassing snafus. He cited the Salahis, a couple who <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/26/dinner.whitehouse.crashers/index.html?eref=rss_crime" target="_blank">snuck into</a> Obama&#39;s first official state dinner in 2009, as well as special requests during the George W. Bush years for agents to chauffeur Dick Cheney&#39;s daughter&#39;s friends to dinner parties (and when Cheney&#39;s wife, Mary, threw a fit after being told this was impossible, she got her detail leader removed by senior agency officals).</p>
<p>
	Still, the majority of the more than 100 agents Kessler has interviewed over the years don&#39;t imbibe in excess with any kind of frequency. And even though it&#39;s not great for the Secret Service&#39;s image that an overserved agent mistook a hotel hallway for a bed, no laws were broken and no one got hurt. Back in Dan Emmett&#39;s day&mdash;which included both Bush presidencies and the Clinton years&mdash;untoward boozing like that would have been punished with 30 days &quot;on the beach,&quot; which is to say non-paid leave.</p>
<p>
	In this era of 24-hour media coverage, however, every time an agent gets too drunk to stand it&#39;s a news story and a black eye for the Secret Service. Its long-simmering alcohol problem can&#39;t be hidden from the public anymore, and bringing the hammer down on the agents hapless or unlucky enough to get caught isn&#39;t going to solve anything. Clearly, the guys in charge of protecting the president need to be protected from themselves.</p>

<title>E-Cigarette Juice Poisoned Another Kid</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/e-cigarette-juice-poisoned-another-kid</link>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144942/Screenshot-2014-03-26-22-02-21.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 371px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Screencap via <a href="http://www.keyc.com/story/25084042/e-cig-juice-poisoning-case-rise-in-kids" target="_blank">Mankato Local CBS News</a>. Thumbnail via <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/wstryder/" target="_blank">Flickr User Lauri Rantala</a></i></p>
<p>
	The four-year-old son of an Oklahoma City woman named Ren Gaulrapp recently got into her supply of e-ciagrette juice and went to town. He was vomiting and had to be hospitalized, becoming the latest statistic in an apparent rash of of e-juice poisonings. He recovered fully.</p>
<p>
	This was just after a&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/24/business/selling-a-poison-by-the-barrel-liquid-nicotine-for-e-cigarettes.html?_r=0&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">New York Times</a> </em>story had pointed out that there were&nbsp;1,351 cases of some form of poisoning linked to e-juice in 2013, and that this constitutes a 300 percent increase from 2012. With respect to noticeability, it helped that the article carried the headline &quot;Selling Poison by the Barrel.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s possible that the Gaulrapp poisoning case was not notable for anything other than timing, but her account is a little strange. Gaulrapp told her&nbsp;<a href="http://www.news4sanantonio.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/boy-poisoned-ecigarette-liquid-nicotine-9924.shtml">local news station</a>,&nbsp;&ldquo;I hear a little bit of a noise, come in, and he&rsquo;s taken the lid off of all of them and has this liquid everywhere. He&rsquo;s got it all over him. He&rsquo;s been eating it.&quot; It&#39;s odd that there&#39;d be enough around for him to take the lids off &quot;all of them,&quot; and that they were accessible in the first place. Not to mention the child&#39;s ravenous appetite for a toxic chemical, although Gaulrapp mentioned that it was sweet.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144960/Screenshot-2014-03-26-22-05-12.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Screencap&nbsp;via <a href="http://www.news4sanantonio.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/boy-poisoned-ecigarette-liquid-nicotine-9924.shtml">News 4 San Antonio</a></i></p>
<p>
	I recently asked medical toxicologist&nbsp;Dr. Cyrus Rangan about e-cigarette juice. &quot;It does have kind of a palatable taste,&quot; he told me, referring to propylene glycol, the additive that produces the vapor effect. But it&#39;s the nicotine that likely does all of the poisoning. &quot;The amount that&rsquo;s in these e-cigarette preparations is hard to say, because there&rsquo;s really not enough study on these issues to know exactly how much propylene glycol someone&rsquo;s going to be exposed to by smoking these things, or being around someone who&rsquo;s smoking them.&quot;</p>
<p>
	On one hand, maybe e-cigarette smokers are their own worst enemies and don&#39;t deserve to have nice things. It&#39;s not that hard to keep delicious e-juice away from children, or to just opt for child-proof containers. A <a href="http://gizmodo.com/e-cigarette-nicotine-juice-is-poisoning-children-1550295032">Gizmodo article</a> by Mario Aguilar made it clear that child-proofing is common.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144945/Screenshot-2014-03-26-22-40-28.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 318px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Ren Gaulrapp. Screencap via&nbsp;<a href="http://www.keyc.com/story/25084042/e-cig-juice-poisoning-case-rise-in-kids" target="_blank">Mankato Local CBS News</a></i></p>
<p>
	On the other hand, e-juice poisoning isn&#39;t a menace that should have America spooked. The cabinet under every American&#39;s sink contains enough poison to take down the Incredible Hulk. There are plenty of other tasty poisons like antifreeze, which poisons more people than nicotine annually. According to the <a href="http://fluoridealert.org/issues/dental-products/toothpastes/">nutbags who are scared of fluoride</a>,&nbsp;even fluoridated toothpaste directly poisons about 1,000 kids per year, compared to nicotine&#39;s 1,351. I don&#39;t know whether this shows me that fluoride is deceptively dangerous or nicotine is surprisingly harmless.</p>
<p>
	But even if e-juice isn&#39;t as dangerous as all this sensationalism suggests, e-cigarettes have a huge controversy attached to them, and the media seems to be latching onto every sensational headline about e-cigarettes they can find. So for the type of social libertarians gunning for blanket legalization of all the fun substances, nicotine is a case study in letting the user be in control of the drug&mdash;1,351 poisonings is a crummy-sounding record for a new kind of poison just reaching the market.</p>
<p>
	The Man may be coming down unnecessarily on e-cigarettes, and it may not be fair, but the users of these products could maybe try advocating for themselves through their actions. They could be extra, extra responsible and call for regulations that require, say, that repulsive flavors be added to the liquid, or that child-proofing, and boring, kid-unfriendly packaging be made a rule.</p>
<p>
	But try and tell vaping enthusiasts what to do. People who smoke in movie theaters are rebels who don&#39;t need us telling them how not to poison their kids, man.</p>

	<em><span class="photo_caption">Above: Calum Best and Gary Lineker&#39;s brother, looking like things that come out of the woods at night to terrorize villagers</span></em></p>
<p>
	Last week, 2.6 million women sacrificed their makeup, raised their tired arms in the air, pouted, and took a #nomakeupselfie to raise awareness for breast cancer. This week, boys have found their own inane counterpart: the #cockinasock.</p>
<p>
	The cock-in-a-sock concept, though probably as old as socks themselves, was most memorably championed by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and since then it has gone from strength to strength, appearing in <em>American Pie</em>&nbsp;and bringing the homoerotic LOLs far and wide, from boarding school dorms to stinking holiday flats in Tenerife. That is, until now, when it&#39;s become the latest weapon in the fight against ball cancer.</p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;re wondering what putting a sock on your dick and posting a picture of it on the internet has to do with raising money for charity, the mechanism is the same as the #nomakeupselfie. Take your picture, text the word &quot;BEAT&quot; to 70099 to donate three bucks to fighting cancer, and then encourage the giggling co-workers on your Facebook page to do the same. It&rsquo;s the kind of viral campaign that gacky brand marketers strive a lifetime to come up with.</p>
<p>
	Even though a bunch of the people who did a #nomakeupselfie texted the wrong number (which may or may not have anything to do with their interest in the fundraising aspect), it raised more than $13 million in a week for Cancer Research UK. According to the charity&rsquo;s website, this money will tangibly pay for ten clinical trials, which is obviously fucking great.</p>
<p>
	Nonetheless, the web has been awash for the last week with rants about how such campaigns vindicate &ldquo;clicktivism,&rdquo; which is basically the idea that internet activism is lazy and things like online petitions and charity-marketing campaigns are taking the soul out of activism. Obviously there&#39;s some truth to this idea, but I think these lefty evangelists are going to feel pretty fucking stupid if that sweet 13 mill cures a form of cancer.</p>
<p>
	What I will make a call on is that #cockinasock seems to have significantly less to do with its charitable cause than the #nomakeupselfie. How do I know this? Because most of the people who&#39;ve posted a picture of their cock to Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram haven&rsquo;t bothered to include the charity text number, let alone any reference to cancer prevention (<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cockinasock&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime" target="_blank">have a look for yourself</a>). The only thing these cocks in socks seems to be raising are the eyebrows of bored middle-aged women on their lunch breaks and the erections of gay bloggers <a href="http://www.thegailygrind.com/2014/03/27/best-cockinasock-men-putting-cocks-sock-best-thing-ever/" target="_blank">reveling</a> in the explosion of this phenomenon. Also, almost without exception, everyone who&#39;s doing it is a douchebag.</p>
<p>
	I like to think that #cockinasock is a parody&mdash;cynical boys mocking the #nomakeupselfie&rsquo;s ironic disjunction between vulnerability and vanity, or its implication that 3 inches of makeup should be the norm for girls and anything less a novelty. But while <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23titsinmits&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime" target="_blank">#titsinmits</a>, the latest hashtag to emerge, is obviously commenting on how absurd it is to stick a body part in a bit of material and post it for everyone from your teacher to your children to see (I&rsquo;m waiting for #twatsinhats), #cockinasock seems to be little more than poker-faced vanity. Calum Best did one, for fuck&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<!--recommended--><p>
	A hashtag is, in its essence, a call for attention&mdash;the whole point is searchability, visibility. Hashtagging a picture of yourself, let alone your cock, basically means that you want as many people to see it as possible. I do like to imagine the clinical process of taking this unashamedly vain photo, an experience that must feel a bit like filming a <em>Big Brother </em>application video (and describing yourself as &ldquo;really outgoing&rdquo;). When you consider that these boys could always donate the three bucks sans naked selfie, you realize that the cock in a sock really is the domain of the douchebag. And not even in the traditional sense of the sock.</p>
<p>
	The #cockinasock trend is to pumped up bros what Movember is to hipsters. As the #nomakeupselfie is favored by fake tan girls with tattooed eyebrows, so the #cockinasock phenomenon is the refuge of &ldquo;ripped&rdquo; boys with &ldquo;sick&quot; tribal tattoos, the kind of pseudo-macho losers Clive Martin <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/anatomy-of-a-new-modern-douchebag" target="_blank">wrote about</a> in his recent dissection of British lad culture. I suppose that if you&rsquo;re going to take creatine to pump your body up like a lilo, it&rsquo;s just the laws of geometry that your cock is going to look comparatively smaller, and that&rsquo;s without steroids. A legitimized opportunity to photograph your ripped body and cover your tiny cock in a deceptively large appendage must be like Christmas come early. Of course #cockinasock was going to catch on.</p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m glad that most of the boys who&#39;ve posted a #cockinasock photo seem to have benefited physically from their overwhelming arrogance, &#39;cause if naked selfies are going to clog my Twitter feed I&rsquo;d admittedly rather look at six packs than beer bellies. But what really annoys me is the arrogant assumption that anyone actually cares. I don&rsquo;t have a cock, but I can imagine it&rsquo;s a lot more gratifying for people to see it when they&rsquo;ve actually asked.</p>

<title>Syrian Children Are Drawing to Heal the Trauma of War</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/syrian-children-are-drawing-to-heal-the-trauma-from-war</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 11:05:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144783/art-therapy.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 431px;" /></p>
<p>
	In an upscale district of Downtown Beirut, two pre-teen boys rapped in Arabic during an exhibit showcasing the artwork of Syrian refugee children. Ramzi, a 12-year-old originally from Daraa, Syria, beatboxed as his friend Ayham, also from Daraa, spit rhymes. Guests watched quietly, impressed, as the two boys recalled life before the uprising turned civil war wreaked havoc on their country.</p>
<p>
	This was part of an exhibit called &ldquo;Light Against Darkness,&rdquo; the result of a three-month art workshop that focused on helping children overcome the trauma of war through creative expression. Forty-three children produced about 166 works of drawings and clay sculptures, many of which depicted colorful renditions of schools, kids playing together, and families bonding.</p>
<p>
	Others were not so cheery. Suha Wanous, a young girl originally from Latakia, drew a daughter holding her mother&rsquo;s hand while a gun is pressed to her head. In the background of the picture, it&rsquo;s raining and a helicopter is opening fire on a home while two small children lie on the grass bleeding, presumably dead. The organizers of the exhibit explained how Suha used to pass an army checkpoint daily before going to school back in Syria. She used to greet the soldiers <em>assalamu alaykum </em>(meaning &ldquo;peace be upon you&rdquo; in Arabic).</p>
<p>
	Art-therapy sessions first started as a response to sketches like Suha&rsquo;s, said&nbsp;Ali Elshiekh Haidar, a representative of Najda Now, the Syrian NGO that organized the workshop in conjunction with the Norwegian Embassy in Beirut. &ldquo;We want everybody to see that children can overcome the war&hellip; If they don&rsquo;t have the voice, they have the color for everyone to see what they have seen,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	For some children, expressing that voice on paper was no easy task. That&rsquo;s where the Nadja Now center in Shatila comes in. The Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut&rsquo;s southern suburbs is increasingly becoming home to Syrians fleeing the war. Sitting together in the center, Ali showed me dozens of sketches that were painted over in solid black out of angst. &ldquo;At first, they were very stressed. They had a lot of shock from Syria, and they had the idea they could never see anything colorful again,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Since the sessions began, however, the children&rsquo;s spirits seem to have been lifted. Children no longer blacken over their work, and most draw colorful images, including pictures of Syria&rsquo;s green and rugged landscapes. &ldquo;It has helped us forget what we saw in Syria,&rdquo; remarked one young girl of the workshop.</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, Ali admits, children do recreate scenes from the war, especially if they hear bad news from Syria. But as Yasser Moalla, Najda Now&rsquo;s psychotherapist, explained, &ldquo;The purpose isn&rsquo;t to forget the trauma of war, but to overcome it.&rdquo; Many illustrations depicting combat, death, or destruction can still be seen hanging on the walls of the center in Shatila.</p>
<p>
	Even as Najda Now&rsquo;s workshop has helped refugee children deal with the trauma of war, aid workers say more needs to be done for Syria&rsquo;s children. As a joint press conference held by executives from some of the world&rsquo;s largest aid agencies&mdash;Mercy Corps, UNHCR, UNICEF, Save the Children, and World Vision International&mdash;clearly declared in Beirut on March 15, the third anniversary of the Syrian uprising, an entire generation of children are &ldquo;at risk of being lost forever&rdquo; due to the conflict.</p>
<p>
	Syria, they reiterated, is in tatters. Conservative estimates say at least 10,000 children have died from the war, and for those who manage to find refuge in neighboring countries, living conditions are bleak. Lebanon, a country of 4.4 million, has received almost 1 million refugees from the conflict. Of those, 435,000 are school-aged children&mdash;more than the total number of Lebanese children currently enrolled in public schooling&mdash;and nearly 300,000, about 70 percent, remain out of the classroom.</p>
<p>
	Aid agencies, meanwhile, are struggling to keep pace with the depths of the conflict. Budget shortfalls are a problem; UNICEF&rsquo;s 2014 plans, for instance, are only 8 percent funded. Even in the rare case that financial issues aren&rsquo;t present, other obstacles hinder educational programs and psychosocial support. In Lebanon, for example, Syrian children are failing entrance exams for public schools due to substantial differences between the two countries&rsquo; curricula, especially in terms of language requirements. &ldquo;We try to have a lot of them stay in school by having an English program,&rdquo; said Ali. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Andrea Koppel, vice president of global engagement and policy at Mercy Corps, said at the March 15 press conference, &ldquo;If we are going to respond to the needs of children here in Lebanon, in Jordan, in Iraq, in Turkey, let alone inside Syria, we need to have the means to do it.&rdquo; Mercy Corps fundraised in three weeks for Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines what it has in three years for the Syrian war.</p>
<p>
	One American newspaper editor put it perfectly while we were drinking a beer in Beirut: &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t run many Syrian refugee stories anymore. It&rsquo;s become stale. People are now more and more desensitized to the war.&rdquo; Even as, he correctly noted, the conflict is getting much worse. The number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon is projected to top 1.5 million by the end of 2014. That&#39;s almost 35 percent of the country&rsquo;s pre-war population.</p>
<p>
	For people like Ali who are directly involved in humanitarian work on the field, the question isn&rsquo;t about funding or awareness&mdash;it&rsquo;s about basic human rights. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t ask for charity,&quot; he said. &ldquo;We ask for their right to education, their right to live, and their right to a childhood. A lot of the international community has forgotten this.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<title>VICE News: The Devil Tried to Divide Us - Full Length</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	The Central African Republic&#39;s capital of Bangui has seen its Muslim population drop from 130,000 to under 1,000 during the past few months. Over the past year, thousands across CAR have been killed, and nearly a million have been displaced. The United Nations recently stated that the entire Western half of the country has now been cleansed of Muslims.<br />
	<br />
	CAR has never fully recovered from France&#39;s colonial rule, and it has only known ten years of a civilian government&mdash;from 1993 to 2003&mdash;since achieving independence in 1960. Coup after coup, often with French military involvement, has led many to refer to the country as a phantom state. The current conflict has now completely erased the rule of law, leaving the UN and international community looking confused and impotent.<br />
	<br />
	In March 2013, the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, a mostly Muslim rebel alliance, rose up and overthrew the corrupt government of Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, while bringing terror and chaos across the country&mdash;pillaging, killing, and raping with impunity. In response, mostly Christian self-defense forces, called the Anti-Balaka, formed to defend CAR against S&eacute;l&eacute;ka attacks.<br />
	<br />
	Clashes grew more frequent throughout 2013 as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka grew more ruthless. In December 2013, French and African troops went in to disarm the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka and staunch the bloodshed. The Anti-Balaka, seizing on a weakened S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, then went on the offensive.<br />
	<br />
	CAR had no real history of religious violence, and the current conflict is not based on any religious ideology. The fighting, however, turned increasingly sectarian in the fall of 2013, with revenge killings becoming the norm. And as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka&#39;s power waned, the Anti-Balaka fed their need for revenge by brutalizing Muslim civilians.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	&quot;Too few peacekeepers were deployed too late; the challenge of disarming the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, containing the Anti-Balaka, and protecting the Muslim minority was underestimated,&quot; Human Rights Watch said in a recent statement.<br />
	<br />
	The bloodshed has not stopped. The UN is still debating whether or not to send peacekeepers. Even if a peacekeeping operation is approved, it will take six months for troops to be assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Mining Conflicts in Guatemala Are Erupting in Violence</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/under-the-volcano-0000251-v21n3</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" border="0" height="861" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/under-the-volcano/banner.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>An anti-mining banner at the roadblock reads: &ldquo;Defend our Mother Earth from the rats.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p class="p1">
	<span style="float:left;color:black;font-size:47px;line-height:35px;padding-top:7px;padding-right:5px;font-family: Arial;">I</span>n 2000, engineers from Radius Gold, a Vancouver-based mining company, discovered a belt of gold deep inside the Tambor mountains in southern Guatemala. The Guatemalan government promptly issued the company an exploratory license, and for more than a decade, Radius studied the region as a possible base of operations. The proposed mine lies just a few miles from the village of San Jos&eacute; del Golfo and from San Pedro Ayampuc, a small city. Few locals, most of whom are of indigenous Mayan descent, were consulted before Radius moved in. Few of them knew anything was happening at all. They certainly didn&rsquo;t know they were living atop what would become a literal gold mine.</p>
<p class="p1">
	It wasn&rsquo;t until early 2012 that townspeople began to grasp the scope of what was happening just down the road. They watched as truck after truck, loaded with heavy equipment, rumbled down the winding jungle roads that were normally used as routes for <i>colectivo</i> buses and small pickups carrying crates of chickens. In February 2012, Radius obtained final permission from the government to build its mine, which it hoped would pump out as many as 52,000 tons of gold a year. Fearful of what might happen if a big foreign developer started digging into their soil, the community decided to intervene. They formed a human roadblock, manned in rotating shifts by people sitting on plastic chairs. They held banners, and cooked on-site meals for protesters in a makeshift kitchen under a lush canopy of vegetation. The mine has yet to extract a single ounce of gold, and March 2 of this year marks the second anniversary of this roadblock, known as La Puya, which translates to <i>the Point</i>&mdash;as in the tip of a spear.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" border="0" height="420" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/under-the-volcano/back-scar.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>A shooting victim shows a wound from the April 2013 attack near the Escobal silver mine.<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	The human roadblock was the culmination of decades of frustration with the destructive and lucrative mining industry in Guatemala. The industry has benefited the national coffers since the country opened up to foreign mineral extraction in the mid 1990s. But that wealth rarely trickles down to those living in close proximity to the mines, who are the most affected by the damage to the local ecosystem. In San Jos&eacute; del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc, where most residents earn a living as sweet-corn farmers or chicken ranchers, the fear was that the arrival of large-scale industrial mining would suck up and contaminate the local water supply, drying up natural springs, depleting the water table, and polluting it with arsenic.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I visited La Puya in July 2013, after hearing about the many attacks the roadblockers had withstood over the course of the previous year. Five months after La Puya was formed, Radius Gold sold its exploratory license to Kappes, Cassiday &amp; Associates (KCA), a mining company based in Reno, Nevada. The human roadblock drastically increased the risk of the investment, but the structure of the sale was such that Radius wouldn&rsquo;t be paid in full until the mine started producing. This incentivized both companies to get rid of the activists and start digging up gold. In December 2012, the mining companies hired police and private security who arrived en masse at the roadblock and delivered an ultimatum to the protesters: Clear the road, or be removed by force. Steadfast and resolute, the protesters didn&rsquo;t budge&mdash;even when the security detail fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. Instead, the roadblockers lay flat on the dirt road, holding flowers up to the riot-gear-festooned police.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" border="0" height="420" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/under-the-volcano/meeting-with-prez.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Members of La Puya meet with Guatemala&rsquo;s president, center, and interior minister, right.<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	That official attempt to move the roadblock was somewhat chaotic but still respectful of the rule of law, oversimplified as a case of the state wielding its power as a cudgel against protesters illegally blocking a road. But months earlier, Yolanda &ldquo;Yoli&rdquo; Oquel&iacute; Veliz, one of the leaders of La Puya, had gotten a far more acrimonious visit.</p>
<p class="p1">
	On the night of June 13, 2012, as she was driving home from the roadblock, two masked gunmen followed Yoli on motorbikes and shot at her multiple times. &ldquo;I still have the bullet in my back,&rdquo; Yoli told me when I interviewed her at La Puya&rsquo;s camp on a calm, sunny day in July. She craned her neck and pointed at a raised mound of flesh near her kidney.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Although many are undocumented, attacks like the one Yoli survived are all too common. Anti-mining encampments pepper the Guatemalan countryside, and attacks by private security organizations have been reported all over the country. One such case occurred in April 2013, at southeast Guatemala&rsquo;s Escobal silver mine, which is owned by the Canadian-founded company Tahoe Resources. Tahoe&rsquo;s head of security gave orders to open fire on protesters who had been blockading the road near the mine, according to an investigation by Guatemalan newspaper <i>Siglo 21</i> a month later. Six people were badly injured, and the head of security was recorded on tape giving the order to shoot, allegedly saying, &ldquo;Kill those sons of bitches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" border="0" height="419" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/under-the-volcano/prez-and-minister.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Guatemala&rsquo;s president, Otto P&eacute;rez Molina, right, and interior minister, Mauricio L&oacute;pez Bonilla<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	Following the attacks, people from nearby villages began setting vehicles on fire. Riots broke out. Guatemala&rsquo;s president, Otto P&eacute;rez Molina, imposed a &ldquo;state of siege&rdquo; for 30 days, a legal move that gave the military the right to impose martial law on the areas around the mine. The community&rsquo;s blockade was dissolved, and Tahoe has been extracting silver on a commercial scale since January 2014, having begun operations in September last year. According to the company&rsquo;s press materials, Escobal is now poised to become the largest silver mine in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Guatemala sits atop a wealth of natural resources&mdash;nickel, gold, silver, and titanium&mdash;that lie beneath the country&rsquo;s rich volcanic soil. In 1960, the Canadian-owned and -operated International Nickel Company (INCO) became the first transnational mining company to arrive in Guatemala. That year also marked the beginning of a 36-year civil war between the government and a slew of leftist guerrilla groups fighting over land distribution, indigenous rights, and economic equality. The conflict ended in 1996, after sweeping neoliberal economic changes were enacted and many regions of the country previously controlled by rebels were opened up to the mineral-extraction industry.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Since then, the government has granted more than 400 licenses to multinational corporations, and the terms for these companies are exceptionally favorable. The government rarely receives more than 5 percent of a company&rsquo;s earnings, and under the leadership of President P&eacute;rez Molina, corporations pay the government only 1 percent of the value of the minerals they extract. They also get to use local water at no cost. <i>Mineral exploitation </i>is a technical term for the process of mining, and in a very literal sense, communities like those near La Puya are being exploited for their gold, their water, and their wealth, with mining often leaving behind a thoroughly pillaged landscape that is utterly bereft and toxic.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>A farm overlooking the Escobal silver mine<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	On June 12, 2013, I was invited, along with ten representatives of La Puya, to the National Palace in Guatemala to speak with the country&rsquo;s president and its interior minister. The goal was to strike an agreement between activists and the government. The demonstrators at La Puya are the only community-based activists to have been invited to the National Palace for such a meeting. Unbeknownst to them, however, the president had also invited KCA in an attempt to open up dialogue between the two opposing sides. Yoli was furious and refused to speak with KCA executives. Which made perfect sense, considering her explicitly stated objective was the cancellation of all mining licenses within their territories.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;This decision can only be made by the government of Guatemala and therefore cannot be discussed with KCA,&rdquo; she told P&eacute;rez Molina. He thought about this for a minute before asking members of KCA to leave the room, after which the president, the interior minister, and the representatives of La Puya spoke. One of the main issues discussed was an environmental-impact study previously executed by KCA. The study found the environmental and ecological risks posed to areas surrounding the mines to be of relatively low impact&mdash;a conclusion that has since been discredited by several reputable geologists. La Puya successfully argued its case, and the meeting concluded with P&eacute;rez Molina&rsquo;s promising that a second, fully independent study of the effects of mining on the area would be commissioned by the government. In the meantime, KCA was ordered to suspend its operations.</p>
<p class="p1">
	At the moment it felt like a small victory. But as of press time, the promised environmental-impact study has yet to be commissioned, and the scale of attacks against villagers near the mine has increased.</p>

<p class="p1">
	I returned to Guatemala in early December 2013 and visited San Jos&eacute; de Nacahuil, a tiny village about 15 miles from La Puya. On September 7, 2013, 11 people were killed and 28 more were injured there when masked gunmen with automatic weapons stormed the village&rsquo;s main street and opened fire on businesses. Authorities and local newspapers reported that the shootings were gang-related, but the community disputed this charge.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I drove up to San Jos&eacute; de Nacahuil on a single-lane road and talked to local residents. They showed me the cafeteria where ten of the victims from the September 7 attacks had died. Bullet holes riddled the wall. Later, an elderly woman led me to a spot where gunmen had allegedly chased a man and shot him before dragging his body back to the caf&eacute; and dumping him with the others.</p>
<p class="p1">
	According to many residents whom I interviewed, police invaded the small community hours <i>before</i> the massacre, to intimidate and harangue them. After the police had left, the gunmen arrived, tracing the same route as the officers and targeting the same businesses the police had visited.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>The community of La Puya in peaceful resistance<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	Villagers believed that there had been an escalation of the mining corporations&rsquo; intimidation tactics, which now bore all the hallmarks of police collusion and a militia-style subjugation of locals fighting against the degradation of their environment. Their strategy was now one of preemption; police and thugs had shifted their attention from disbanding already-established roadblocks to disrupting nearby communities that might rally to the cause.</p>
<p class="p1">
	It seems that the resistance to mining efforts in this area of rural Guatemala&mdash;and the associated violence&mdash;won&rsquo;t be stopping anytime soon. La Puya might be celebrating its second anniversary, but some protesters are facing criminal charges and trials as their attackers go largely unpunished.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Yoli, the woman who was shot in the back near La Puya, went to court in February 2014, along with six of her fellow protesters from the roadblock. They were charged with kidnapping, coercion, and intimidation, allegations that their supporters claim are false. As of press time, a verdict has not been reached, but to the mining companies it&rsquo;s something of a victory: It has kept Yoli in a courthouse, far away from the roadblocks.</p>

<title>Italy&#039;s Newest Tabloid Is Devoted Entirely to the Pope </title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/italy-has-a-tabloid-magazine-dedicated-to-the-pope</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140656/cover-IL-MIO-PAPA1.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 435px;" /></p>
<p>
	Ever since Pope Francis became the leader of the Catholic Church last year, the mainstream press has gone nuts. Since his ascension to the top of the Vatican, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (his pre-pope name) has been called a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/pope-francis-gentle-revolution-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140128" target="_blank">revolutionary</a>,&rdquo; a &ldquo;<a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/26/like-a-rock-star-pope-francis-calls-for-disorder-in-rio/" target="_blank">rock star</a>,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/01/pope-francis-promoted-rockstar-super-hero/357503/" target="_blank">superhero</a>.&rdquo; He was also proclaimed to be a living saint for performing a miracle only a few hours after his investiture in March 2013&mdash;when he managed to make Rome&rsquo;s public transportation <a href="http://www.leggo.it/vaticano/papa_francesco_i_romani_ringraziano_primo_miracolo_metro_e_bus_funzionano/notizie/219632.shtml" target="_blank">work properly</a> (for a couple of hours, at least).</p>
<p>
	That was just the beginning. After suffering through the reign of notoriously non-media-friendly Pope Benedict (although Benedict&#39;s red <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/22/AR2005122201914.html" target="_blank">Prada shoes</a>&nbsp;regularly made headlines), Italian journalists couldn&rsquo;t believe their luck when they realized there was finally a pope who regularly <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2293785/Pope-bus-Francis-shows-hes-man-people-hops-board-minibus-church-day-job.html" target="_blank">rode the bus</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/pope-brazil-carries-own-luggage_n_3634674.html" target="_blank">carried his own bag</a> and who wasn&rsquo;t immune to the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/pope-francis-cancels-audiences-due-illness-133413038--finance.html" target="_blank">flu</a>.</p>
<p>
	So Pope Francis had already been on plenty of magazine and tabloid covers before March 5, when the first issue of <em>Il Mio Papa </em>[&quot;My Pope&quot;], a weekly magazine devoted to His Holiness, hit newstands. <em>Il Mio Papa</em>&#39;s editor is Aldo Vitali, who is also behind Italy&rsquo;s best-selling TV listings and celebrity news magazine, <em>TV Sorrisi e Canzoni </em>[&quot;TV Smiles and Songs&quot;], and the <a href="http://www.mondadori.it/Media/Comunicati-stampa/2014/MONDADORI-LANCIA-IL-MIO-PAPA-IL-PRIMO-SETTIMANALE-AL-MONDO-INTERAMENTE-DEDICATO-A-PAPA-FRANCESCO" target="_blank">official press release</a>&nbsp;announced that <em>Il Mio Papa </em>would have<em> </em>&ldquo;a positive and popular point of view, with colorful layouts and highly emotional pictures.&rdquo; The publisher, Mondadori (which is owned by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi) has high hopes for the publication, as it has an announced circulation of 3 million and a PR campaign that includes banners in St. Peter&rsquo;s Square in Vatican City.</p>
<p>
	(It may or may not have been inspired by a Photoshopped parody of <em>Tiger Beat </em>featuring Pope Francis that was on the website of left-wing magazine <em>Mother Jones </em><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/03/latest-news-tiber-beat" target="_blank">over a year ago</a>.<em>)</em></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s sort of odd to launch a new weekly magazine at a time when the print media is supposedly dying, but Vitali seems to believe that the pope&#39;s appeal can overcome publishing trends. In a letter to his readers, the editor wrote: &ldquo;The Pope never stops&mdash;every day he surprises us with his firm decisions and his unpredictable gestures... If you are reading these lines it means that we have something in common: an admiration and deep appreciation for Pope Francis.&rdquo; <em>Il Mio Papa</em>, he continued, will aim not so much to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; the world&#39;s top Catholic but to &ldquo;help him spread his message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I leafed through the first issue (it&#39;s 68 pages long and costs 50 cents) to get a sense of what that looks lik, and found that the tone of the articles was, generally speaking, &ldquo;The pope always hugs the children passed to him by their parents,&quot; and &ldquo;Often mothers ask for a kiss for their child and the pope is always surrounded by children who are happy to be next to him,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Pope Francis is constantly showing his enthusiasm for his devotees, and St. Peter&#39;s Square is everyone&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The best part is the photos that resemble the candid celebrity shots commonly found in tabloids, except, instead of D-listers groping C-listers in taxis, you get Pope Francis &ldquo;walking among the happy crowd&rdquo; in St. Peter&rsquo;s square. You also have pope-related news items, like the one below (at left) about how there&#39;s going to be a TV show inspired by the pope&#39;s life in Argentina between 1976 and 1981, &ldquo;when he opposed Jorge Rafael Videla&rsquo;s regime, helping the underprivileged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140585/p17-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 177px;" /></p>
<p>
	After the &ldquo;political&rdquo; section (bo-ring!), <em>ll Mio Papa </em>advises readers on how to enjoy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus" target="_blank">Angelus prayer</a> in St. Peter&#39;s Square (&ldquo;You can see the pope better from the first quarter of the square, on the right&rdquo;) and offers glimpses into the pope&#39;s personal life: He &ldquo;declined to live in the Papal apartments&rdquo; and &ldquo;prefers to live in a hotel room.&rdquo; That one comes with a map of the papal apartments that looks like a children&#39;s-book illustration:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140586/p28-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 314px;" /></p>
<p>
	Readers can also treat themselves to a pull-out centerfold of the pontiff that could decorate &ldquo;your room or your place of work&rdquo; so that &ldquo;the pope&#39;s smile and prayers will always be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Toward the end you&#39;ll find a photo story about the pope&rsquo;s first year in the Vatican, in which you can spot the selfie he took with some kids in August 2013, captioned &ldquo;A technological pope.&rdquo; A few pages later you can find a guide to signing up for Twitter in order to &ldquo;receive Francis&rsquo;s messages on your phone (it&rsquo;s easy and free)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Page 55 is by far my favorite. Headlined &ldquo;Francesco Helps Us,&rdquo; it maps out the components of the Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;five-finger prayer&rdquo; (for an English explanation of the five-finger prayer, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/yimcatholic/2013/09/too-cool-not-to-share-pope-franciss-five-finger-prayer.html" target="_blank">click here</a>).</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/35d5bfb07fa9aa137b075560ce409296/tumblr_n1yomyoBZT1skgqflo1_1280.jpg"><img class="embeddlr_photo" src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/35d5bfb07fa9aa137b075560ce409296/tumblr_n1yomyoBZT1skgqflo1_400.jpg" /></a></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<span class="photo_caption">Image via Tumblr</span></p>
<p>
	The magazine&#39;s ads make it clear that <em>Il Mio Papa</em>&#39;s target demo is older people who are having trouble pooping. &ldquo;&#39;Kilocal Woman&#39; helps you fight weight gain&rdquo; reads one. &ldquo;Wake up your bowels and fight constipation&rdquo; is another tagline, and not far away is &ldquo;Recharge your bowels with good bacteria.&rdquo; There are also ads for hearing aids, beauty creams, and products that make &ldquo;your legs look like they did when you were 20.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What does the actual pope think about <em>Il Mio Papa</em>? Well, judging from this <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/14_marzo_04/vi-racconto-mio-primo-anno-papa-90f8a1c4-a3eb-11e3-b352-9ec6f8a34ecc.shtml" target="_blank">interview</a> with newspaper <em>Corriere della Sera,</em> he&#39;s not very happy&mdash;he told the interviewer that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be portrayed as a superhero or a rock star, because he&#39;s still a man that &ldquo;laughs, cries, sleeps calmly, and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Good luck with that, dude.</p>

<title>Anyone Who Isn’t Dead Is a Witch</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/anyone-who-isnt-dead-is-a-witch</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	Why isn&rsquo;t everything more messed up? Everything is always the wrong kind of messed up, tangibly messed up, like big-box stores or an entire television network dedicated to 24-hour-a-day celebrity coverage. When I was in second grade, this kid Cory told me his uncle had gotten his head cut off by a Ouija board because he wasn&rsquo;t treating it right, and I haven&rsquo;t slept well since. That&rsquo;s the sort of messed up I want. I want to find art that makes that feeling seem like one of a million, not one in a million. I want a shitload of witches on my stoop with some candy and some diagrams of the insides of human bodies.</p>
<p>
	That stuff is still out there; it&rsquo;s just not easy to find. Here are two new little spell books.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144729/SCARECRONE.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 957px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong><em><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2559">Scarecrone</a>&nbsp;</em>by Melissa Broder</strong></p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;ve ever read Melissa Broder, or if you&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/melissabroder">follow her on Twitter</a>, you know her spirit is entrenched somewhere halfway between the club and the void. There&rsquo;s an odd balance of metaphysical transcendence and material bling-brain to quite a number of her lines, and she is unafraid to have her idea of God bump shoulders with both blood and Tumblr.</p>
<p>
	Broder says shit like: &ldquo;Nobody bleeds white like I bleed white / Into a ditch the shadow of my bloodbag is white / I want a darker aura, like I want to be gorgeous.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a weird brand of inner loathing mashed with inner haunting lurking here, but what I like best about Broder, oddly, is her morality. As coal-black as her imagery gets, and as overriding as the sadness in her ongoing personal desolation might be, there is an unrelenting sense that there&rsquo;s a reason for it. That humans, perhaps, carry hell because they are hell, and that really the self is just a vessel toward something no one really has a name for.</p>
<p>
	That Broder wields this, and isn&rsquo;t just pumping out poems full of wry cartoon loathing and social exuberance, shifts the center of the book not onto the self but onto something larger, undefined. I don&rsquo;t know what a book is if not a latch to elsewhere, and <em>Scarecrone</em> has pressed its skull against the hidden door. It is neither drunk nor ecstatic to be here&mdash;it is a state unto itself.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SELF-PORTRAIT AS SATAN</strong></p>
<p>
	My wings are made of garbage</p>
<p>
	At least they can be touched</p>
<p>
	I want you I want you</p>
<p>
	Especially the old and ugly</p>
<p>
	Take these bottles of soda</p>
<p>
	And tubes of cherry lipstick </p>
<p>
	These are my demon breakfast </p>
<p>
	And my red red hooves </p>
<p>
	It is better to be satan </p>
<p>
	With half-trash filling </p>
<p>
	Than try to stuff your holes with clouds</p>
<p>
	Lacerating on your nails </p>
<p>
	I once stuffed my holes with halos </p>
<p>
	Until honey dripped down </p>
<p>
	The honey smelled like village women </p>
<p>
	Full of want and feces </p>
<p>
	Village women screaming out for anything alive</p>
<p>
	I shut them up with jars of eye cream </p>
<p>
	And a plastic head </p>
<p>
	I gave them eggs of pantyhose </p>
<p>
	And a melting cathedral </p>
<p>
	I gave them black snakeskins </p>
<p>
	And menstrual sponges </p>
<p>
	I gave them sainted men </p>
<p>
	With semisoft dicks </p>
<p>
	Making it hard </p>
<p>
	To feel totally fucked</p>
<p>

<p>
	<strong><em><a href="http://www.calamaripress.com/Niceties.htm">Niceties: Aural Ardor, Pardon Me</a>&nbsp;</em>by<em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Elizabeth Mikesch</strong></p>
<p>
	From the very first sentence of <em>Niceties</em>, Elizabeth Mikesch&rsquo;s first book, you know you&rsquo;re in for something Beckettian: &ldquo;Would we say that we would go a ways to the place of the one who we could never name?&rdquo; Among those who talk about the music of a sentence, there are at least two kinds: those who like the music to do all the work, to the point where you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Please, kill me, I want to hear no more,&rdquo; and those, like Mikesch, for whom the music is just a cover for what is more like a series of hundreds of eruptions, one after another.</p>
<p>
	Like <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/diane-williams">Diane Williams</a> and Noy Holland, here is a person who can take any sort of world and make it work. Whether it&rsquo;s the complex image of a dad telling his daughter it&rsquo;s time to shave her vagina, or kids picking lice out of each other&rsquo;s hair, the context is like a gel&mdash;a thing in and of itself rather than described or played out for entertainment.</p>
<p>
	The subject matter floods past in currents that run deep as any corridor. &ldquo;I got robbed,&rdquo; one narrator mentions sidelong, before taking her roommate to task in the next sentence for leaving her panties all over the place, and then in the next to mentioning how she keeps a bunch of knives beside her bed. There is no whimsy here: Each paragraph is a slab of wicked meat. You might have only 87 pages, but each is worth at least a couple other volumes, and even if you&rsquo;re not sure where you ended up it still keeps tingling, like getting a hex put on you. Or sleeping with a Ouija board.</p>
<p>
	<strong>&ldquo;Under Doors of Foreigners&rdquo; (from <em>Niceties</em>)</strong></p>
<p>
	What I don&rsquo;t know about a house is which dream I will have sleeping inside of its strange beds, above its pallets when I am guest again.</p>
<p>
	I know that my mother made French fries for father at four a.m. in her mother&rsquo;s house, and it made her mother&rsquo;s house burn down. She fell asleep and the grease burned up even the family photos.</p>
<p>
	I know there are houses I have slept in where I&rsquo;ve been bitten by spiders for closing my eyes. People eat spiders in their sleep every year they say. I think that&rsquo;s why I am always sleepy but never can. I also think a house can have a room that is so much of one person that you know them now so much you will finally sleep after all. Sometimes somebody wants you to be the room they fall asleep in so much that you never will.</p>
<p>
	I slept in a foreigner bed once, a mother and father&rsquo;s. They had two huge crosses above their headboard. I had a new tattoo. Their son laughed at my arm during dinner but covered his mouth. I didn&rsquo;t give more than one word before bed. Above where he slept, he had pictures of pigtailed girls and, too, of cartoons. I didn&rsquo;t understand the soap there, but I wanted to wash around where I started to sweat. I was scared about the ink, and there were so many bloody statues that I stayed awake feeling their marriage all over me.</p>
<p>
	There were gold-framed photos of their loved ones on either side protecting them. I wrapped my arm in a scarf and watched until the son woke up.</p>

<title>Meet the &#039;Water Witcher&#039; Who Is Helping California Farmers Deal with Drought </title>

<p class="p1">
	I live in a city and I&rsquo;ve never seen a water well. It sounds exotic, or even fictional. I just turn on my faucet, water comes out, and I don&rsquo;t have to consider its source.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Here in the eastern United States, we&rsquo;re doing OK when it comes to precipitation, but our West Coast neighbors are seriously suffering from a terrible drought. California&mdash;often referred to as our nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;breadbasket&rdquo; because it grows <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/">nearly half</a> of all domestically produced fruits, vegetables, and nuts&mdash;is deep into its second year of reduced rainfall, the likes of which the state hasn&rsquo;t seen since the 70s. That much food on the line means a lot of profits are in danger. With this year&rsquo;s drastically reduced crop yields, food prices across the country are rapidly increasing. In the next few months, the prices of artichokes, celery, broccoli, and cauliflower could rise by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-07/california-drought-impact-seen-spreading-from-fires-to-food-cost.html">10 percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">
	These high stakes are making California farmers both desperate and creative, because they&rsquo;re looking for ways to find water underground since it refuses to fall from the sky. A couple of weeks ago, an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/02/water-witches-california-drought_n_4885092.html">article</a> about &ldquo;water witches&rdquo; caught my eye. The piece described so-called witches in California using the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Dowsing-or-Divining-Rods">age-old technique</a> of the divining rod&mdash;usually just a tree branch&mdash;to tap into energy fields below the surface of the land to locate groundwater and pinpoint where to drill wells. This common practice, also known as dowsing, has been around since at least the 15<sup>th</sup> century and has been also used to unearth precious metals, gravesites, and oil reserves. In spite of its popularity, witching has long been stigmatized. In 1518, Martin Luther thought the notion of walking around with a wooden stick in the woods was completely freaky, and decried it as occultism. Seventeenth-century France even put strict limitations on water witches. But while scientific bodies such as the <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/edu/dowsing.html">US Geological Survey</a> claim that witching is about as successful at finding water as pure guesswork, it continues, after many, many centuries, to remain popular: Winemaker Robert Mondavi, a practicing water witch himself, has popularized the practice in California&rsquo;s vineyards, and even John Franzia&mdash;the Two-Buck Chuck guy&mdash;advocates dowsing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	I wanted to hear about witching firsthand, so I called Sharron Hope, the president of Gold Country Dowsers, the Oroville, CA&ndash;based chapter of the <a href="http://dowsers.org/index.php">American Society of Dowsers</a>. Hope, who has been dowsing in California since the 70s, said that in recent years her business has more than quadrupled. Just don&rsquo;t call her a witch.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>VICE: When you go out dowsing for water, how exactly does that work?</b><br />
	<b>Sharron Hope:</b> I head to the property, I find a tree branch, and I hold it out in front of me. Then, I turn around in a circle, and when the branch senses energy, it&rsquo;ll start dipping down towards the earth, but just minutely&mdash;you have to really concentrate on what you&rsquo;re doing; you have to forget about everything else, just relax and turn slowly, and when you feel that dip, you walk in that direction. When you get over the site where there is the most water, that stick is gonna point down to the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>You say &ldquo;when the stick senses energy.&rdquo; What kind of energy are we talking about here?</b><br />
	Water, of course, is flowing underground, and it&rsquo;s flowing past rocks, and rocks actually store energy. So as it goes through those rocks, the water strips off some of that energy&mdash;some of those electrons&mdash;from the rocks. And that energy goes shooting straight up. That&rsquo;s what the tree branch, up on the surface, is responding to. I started doing water wells in 1979. And I&rsquo;ve noticed over the years that there are heavily-traveled deer trails over water veins. And a lot of times, when I go out to dowse, the spot that I find to drill the well is where two deer trails cross. So wild animals, too, can pick up on that energy that comes up from the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>The process sounds kind of supernatural. Is that where the name &ldquo;water witch&rdquo; comes from?</b><br />
	Actually, the name comes from the fact that a lot of dowsers, historically, used a branch from the witch hazel tree to find water. But the overall term is dowser&mdash;you know, we don&rsquo;t like to be called water witches, actually. It provokes snide comments. It&rsquo;s really just an old-fashioned term that people used 100 years ago.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1">
	<b>It sounds like dowsing has a long history.</b><br />
	As far as we can figure out, the practice goes back at least 10,000 years. There are actually petroglyphs of men holding a tree branch and looking for water. And of course, before we had machinery and drilling rigs, we had to hand-dig wells, so you better believe they had some kind of methods to find the water. And basically, most of &#39;em just used a tree branch.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>OK, so back to the branch. Once you find your spot, what do you do?</b><br />
	I&rsquo;ll mark that spot, and then I&rsquo;ll get my L-rods out. They&rsquo;re made of solid brass, and they have a copper handle. So I&rsquo;m holding on to the handles, and I&rsquo;m standing a little bit away from the site that the branch found. And I move towards that site, and I get right over it, and then those two L-rods will cross.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>So they&rsquo;re sort of drawing together of their own accord?</b><br />
	Yes, they go together of their own accord. They cross and make an &ldquo;X.&rdquo; And if I back up again and walk around that site, maybe about 8 to 10 feet away from it, as I get to a water vein, those rods are gonna separate and make a line. That indicates the edge of the water vein. So that&rsquo;s the process that I use. In fact, I was out dowsing a well in Berry Creek today for a family who bought ten acres out there, and they want to have a well for a little family garden. And last Thursday, I was out at a vineyard&mdash;it was almost 200 acres, and I dowsed several well sites for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Do vineyards make up a lot of your clientele?</b><br />
	Oh, I have a variety of clients. A lot of homeowners around here have property with acreage, and for a lot of them, their wells have either gone dry because of the drought, or the water table has gotten so low that they&rsquo;re not getting enough out of their wells to run their households. We have rice farmers around here, and I&rsquo;ve dowsed wells for them. We have a lot of agriculture around here. I&rsquo;ve done organic orchards, citrus farms, olive orchards&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot that I&rsquo;ve done in the past 35 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<b>Has your business increased in the past couple of years because of the terrible drought?</b><br />
	Oh, definitely, definitely. For most of my career, I&rsquo;d been dowsing about one well a month. Now I&rsquo;m doing anywhere from one to four a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Do you get calls from people who had never heard of dowsing before?</b><br />
	Yes, the well-drillers are actually referring people to me. Because the well-driller, you know, he just drills a hole. He says, &ldquo;Where do you want me to drill your well?&rdquo; And at $15&ndash;50 a foot for drilling, you don&rsquo;t really want to have to guess at where he should start drilling&mdash;you want to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Thanks, Sharron.</b></p>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144686/molly-crabapple-cecily-mcmillian.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 525px; " /></p>
<p>
	<span class="photo_caption">Illustration by Molly Crabapple</span></p>
<p>
	Last week, I sketched an evidentiary hearing for a woman named Cecily McMillan.</p>
<p>
	Two years ago, I&#39;d seen Cecily convulse in handcuffs as the police shut down an <a href="https://news.vice.com/articles/the-case-that-could-rock-the-occupy-movement" target="_blank">Occupy Wall Street</a> protest. Cecily was an organizer. A plain-clothes cop had grabbed her breast from behind, hard enough to leave a bruise shaped like his handprint. Instinctively, she elbowed him. Most women would do the same if a man grabbed them from behind.</p>
<p>
	The cops beat Cecily till they broke her ribs. As she had a seizure on the pavement, the crowd screamed for the police to call 911. The police just watched.</p>
<p>
	Two years later, Cecily is charged with assaulting an officer. She faces seven years in prison.</p>
<p>
	In that fake-wood courtroom in lower Manhattan, the judge told Cecily&#39;s lawyer the fact that her arresting officer had beaten up other people was not relevant to her case. His records would be sealed. Afterward, addressing her supporters, Cecily tried to hide the tremor in her voice.</p>
<p>
	Courtrooms are a violent theater. The violence happens off-scene: in Rikers Island where a homeless man recently <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/american-jails-are-wretched-hell-holes-for-the-mentally-ill">baked to death</a>; in the shackles and beatings and the years far from everything you love. But the courtroom itself is the performative space, the stage where the best story triumphs, and where all parties, except (usually) the defendant, are just playing parts.</p>
<p>
	In the past three years, I&#39;ve sketched many courtrooms. I sat in Fort Meade drawing the back of Chelsea Manning&#39;s cropped blonde hair. In <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/it-dont-gitmo-better-than-this-0001000-v20n8">Guant&aacute;namo Bay</a>, I drew <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/molly-crabapple-sent-us-sketches-from-khalid-sheikh-mohammeds-trial-at-gitmo">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> through layers of bulletproof glass. I&#39;ve been to hacker trials and misdemeanor court and the sentencings of friends&mdash;though at my lone disorderly conduct hearing, I got an ACD (which is short for adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so fast I couldn&#39;t even reach for my sketchpad.</p>
<p>
	The trials I&#39;ve drawn have mostly been politically motivated. The defendants, however victimized, were also heroes of their stories. They read statements they agonized over, knowing that it might be a long time before they could speak again. The courts tried to stamp out all that was special, to make them fit into what activist Mariame Kaba of Project NIA calls the &ldquo;widget factory&rdquo; that is the criminal justice system. Their supporters tried to tear through the ritual, to remind them they were important and loved.</p>
<p>
	At <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-torture-of-bradley-manning">Chelsea Manning</a>&#39;s trial, her supporters wore shirts reading &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; Chelsea was not allowed to turn around to see.</p>
<p>
	But the average defendant isn&#39;t a famous whistleblower. He&#39;s a person of color charged with a drug crime. Most trials resemble not grand dramas but factory farms. The raw material is a person. The product is a prisoner. Trials are deliberately dull. They move glacially, on state time rather than human time. If you hire your own lawyers&mdash;a necessity to have a chance of winning&mdash;you&#39;ll blow through your life savings. As the cop clich&eacute; goes, &ldquo;You can beat the rap, but you can&#39;t beat the ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Yet America loves her trials. Courtrooms are secular churches. Bow your head, hush your voice. With enough <em>Law and Order</em> episodes, the criminal justice system gets mixed up with justice. Square-jawed prosecutors will punish the wicked. The innocent will be redeemed.</p>
<p>
	Real trials like acquitted baby killer Casey Anthony&#39;s are layered over fictional ones. They&#39;re outlets for collective sadism. Look at the murderess. Are we not pure?</p>
<p>
	The pop culture courtroom is familiar to all Americans. It is both grand and comforting, a pillar of our democracy. So we ignore the reality that we imprison more of our population than any country in the world, in horrific conditions, half of them for drugs, disproportionately the poor and brown.</p>
<p>
	If &ldquo;getting your day in court&rdquo; means justice, why should you complain if you&#39;re locked in a box when that day is done?</p>
<p>
	No one who&#39;s spent time in courts believes trials are about truth.</p>
<p>
	A former prosecutor I spoke to told me he&#39;d been trained to conduct a trial like a performance. It was all about keeping the audience engaged. He would point at the defendant, stabbing the air with his finger, to show the jury that they too should point at him with a guilty verdict. The prosecutor told me that there was no feeling worse than hearing &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; It was 12 average Americans saying he sucked at his job.</p>
<p>
	Defense attorneys I spoke with agreed. It&#39;s all about the story&mdash;something that public defenders, who get paid nil and don&#39;t have the power of the state behind them, are usually too overburdened to craft.</p>
<p>
	At sentencing, performance and pragmatism coalesce into poison. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor will always paint the defendant as a threat to all good citizens snug in their beds. To keep them safe, the defendant must get as many years as possible. But weeks before trial began, that same prosecutor will usually have offered the defendant a plea deal that was a fraction of that sentence.</p>
<p>
	Because the entire system would implode if everyone demanded a trial, prosecutors push plea bargains like restaurants hawking early bird specials. But instead of money, they&#39;re haggling over life. If you&#39;re too poor for a lawyer or have already spent months in jail because you can&#39;t make bail, plea bargains can be irresistible. They account for 95 percent of felony convictions.</p>
<p>
	Marissa Alexander, a PhD and mom who fired a warning shot at the ceiling to stop her husband from beating her, was offered three years as a plea deal for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. She refused, knowing herself innocent. The judge sentenced her to 20 years. Now, she&#39;s appealing. If she loses, the prosecutor wants to lock her up for 60.</p>
<p>
	This is a &ldquo;trial tax&rdquo; you pay if you annoy the courts by insisting you are innocent.</p>
<p>
	At trial, you better fit a casting agent&#39;s idea of &ldquo;Not Guilty.&rdquo; Cecily McMillan is small, white, and lovely in her blowout and blazer. White America seldom imagines that little white girls, like Cecily and me, will punch cops. We wear the costume of innocence. It&rsquo;s not surefire, but it helps.</p>
<p>
	The poor, the brown, the trans&mdash;to juries, they&#39;re guilty unless proven otherwise. Innocence is the absence of guilt. It is near impossible to prove a negative.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re too poor to afford bail, you arrive in court in chains. If you have no family to bring you a suit, you wear your prison jumpsuit. During her murder trial, Angela Davis&#39;s team fought for her to get bail. They wanted her to go into the courtroom each day in her own clothes, looking like a woman who was and would be free.</p>
<p>
	When I write about courts, there&#39;s pressure to add <em>of course</em>.&nbsp;<em>Of course</em> some defendants are guilty.&nbsp;<em>Of course</em> there are rapists and murderers. <em>Of course</em> judges and prosecutors see themselves as good people doing a tough job, trying to get through the day. Yet this <em>of course</em> excuses too much. It excuses a system drenched with racism, corruption, and violence. It excuses a contest where he with the most cash wins. Where instead of truth, justice or mercy, lawyers must craft fables&mdash;tales rigged in favor of those who already have the most.</p>
<p>
	As I sat at Cecily&#39;s trial, my friends were in Philly, attending hacker <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/lulz-and-leg-irons-in-the-courtroom-with-weev">Andrew &ldquo;weev&rdquo; Auernheimer</a>&#39;s appeal. Auernheimer himself was in solitary, locked with his thoughts in a six-foot-by-11-foot box.</p>
<p>
	Last March, I attended Auernheimer&#39;s sentencing. Hacker Jaime Cochran had taken the train 20 hours from Chicago to support him. She was thrown out of the courtroom for touching her phone. Jaime stood on the other side of the door. Every time it opened, she screamed &ldquo;Dongs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Afterwards, some criticized Jaime for not respecting the court. But from where I sat, it felt like the most human thing anyone could have done.</p>
<p>
	The court was locking up Jaime&#39;s friend. She couldn&#39;t stop that. At least she could show that she wasn&#39;t buying their show. Jaime told me later that she refused to be a &ldquo;docile spectator&rdquo; in her friend&#39;s life.</p>
<p>
	After one trial, the lawyers move on to another. Judges hear the next case. But for most defendants, courtrooms are preludes to cages. After the theater of justice, reality is theirs alone.</p>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144726/AzqV9uyCcAARy8g.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /><br />
	<font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><i>A fire at the Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California, forced 15,000 people to seek medical attentiion. Photo courtesy of <a href="http://ellabakercenter.org/">Ella Baker Center for Human Rights</a>.</i></span></font></p>
<p class="p1">
	Richmond is tucked into California&#39;s western tricep, a former wine town with a population just over 100,000. Under the administration of Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, the town is the <a href="http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume11/issue1/elections1.php">largest city in the United States with a Green Party mayor</a>. It&rsquo;s also an oil town&mdash;in 1901, Standard Oil set up a tank farm, choosing the location for its easy access to San Francisco Bay. Soon after, a western terminus of the Santa Fe Railroad was built in Richmond to handle the outflux of crude. Over the course of the 20th&nbsp;century, Standard Oil became the Standard Oil Company of California (SOCAL), and later, Chevron.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Throughout the 90s, the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/sherman.html">Richmond refinery was fined thousands of dollars for unsafe conditions, explosions, major fires, and chemical leaks</a>, as the plant oozed chlorine and sulfur trioxide into Richmond&rsquo;s atmosphere. In August of 2012, <a href="http://www.csb.gov/chevron-refinery-fire/">the Richmond refinery exploded</a>&nbsp;after Chevron ignored the warning of corroding pipes from the local safety board. The disaster was linked to aging pipes, which were simply clamped instead of replaced altogether. Some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Richmond-sues-Chevron-over-refinery-fire-4703370.php">15,000 residents in the surrounding area were forced to seek medical treatment</a>, and Chevron&rsquo;s CEO, John Watson, <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_23005441/chevron-ceos-pay-jumps-30-percent-32-2">got a $7.5 million dollar raise</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" scrolling="no" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QiILbGbk8Qk" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">
	Now that some time has passed, Chevron has decided to modernize the refinery and has simultaneously sponsored the creation of the&nbsp;<a href="http://richmondstandard.com/"><em>Richmond Standard</em></a>, an online newspaper that is decidedly positive about anything the company does. The paper, whose name is a sly reference to the company that Chevron grew out of,&nbsp;covers minimally reported local stories on crime, public meetings, and sports. It also features a section called &quot;<a href="http://richmondstandard.com/category/chevron-speaks/">Chevron Speaks</a>,&quot; which works as a place for the company to put forth its ideology. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/New-Chevron-website-covers-Richmond-news-5339356.php">According to&nbsp;<em>SF Gate</em></a>, &quot;the idea of the nation&#39;s second-largest oil company funding a local news site harkens back to an era of journalism when business magnates often owned newspapers to promote their personal, financial, or political agendas. Now that mainstream newspapers are struggling to survive, online news sites are testing ways to fund their operations.&quot;</p>
<p class="p1">
	The founding of the <em>Standard</em> coincides with a modernization initiative at the facility that would allow it to process fuel with higher percentages of sulfur, the key to the corrosion that resulted in the 2012 plant explosion. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re planning on doubling the sulfur content of the crude,&rdquo; Andres Soto, the Richmond community organizer at Communities for a Better Environment, told me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	According to Soto, Chevron wants to go from 1.5 percent sulfur content to 3 percent. Outside of the fear of another explosion, there is a serious environmental problem with the modernization and the refinery in general. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re publically claiming there will be no net increase in emissions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Our suspicion is they plan on releasing more greenhouse and particulate emissions, here in the local area, in exchange for cap and trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	For those of you unfamiliar with cap and trade, it&rsquo;s essentially when you let one of your refineries pollute above the federal limit in exchange for another refinery polluting below the federal limit. The differentials from &ldquo;caps&rdquo; are traded so that in the end everyone is supposed to be meeting requirements, on average. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the single largest refinery on the West Coast of the United States. As a facility, it&rsquo;s the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in California,&rdquo; Andres says. He believes that the refinery will cause serious pollution in the Bay Area, and that the company will start using the port of Richmond to ship tar sands to China that aren&rsquo;t legal for fuel in the United States because of the sulfur content.</p>
<p class="p1">
	As you may have heard in relation to the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tar-sands-and-keystone-xl-pipeline-impact-on-global-warming/"><span class="s2">Keystone Pipeline proposals</span></a>, tar sands are semi-solid petroleum-and-sand mixtures that are being harvested in Alberta, Canada. The process of extracting the petroleum wastes a lot of water, <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/with_tar_sands_development_growing_concern_on_water_use/2672/"><span class="s2">and a Yale article</span></a> reported last year that a company extracting petroleum used 370 million cubic meters of fresh water in 2011. Chevron could export the sands to China for their needs and save Americans time and resources, but Andres points out the emissions from shipping and the emissions China will create will circle back to America with the winds.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Chevron is attempting to convince the public that the refinery is a good idea in the pages of the <em>Richmond Standard</em>, typically using the <a href="http://richmondstandard.com/category/chevron-speaks/"><span class="s2">promise of more jobs</span></a> and more money. Andres says the company is buying every billboard in town. The billboards often depict people of color, likely in an effort to convince minorities that they can trust a multinational oil conglomerate.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Richmond is <a href="http://richmondca.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm"><span class="s2">about a quarter Latino and a third African American</span></a>, so there is a big population for Chevron to market to with these advertisements. Andres believes that, regardless of race, the low economic standing of many Richmond residents risks the town being subject to anything that creates jobs. He also believes that Richmond is becoming more progressive, and that people will hopefully spend more time educating themselves on the issues.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Not only is the company buying up all the billboards, but in 2010 the company spent <a href="http://www.mayorgayle.net/e-newsletters/2012Nov2.htm"><span class="s2">$1.2 million</span></a> on city council elections, and Andres claims they spent an additional $2 million on the California state legislature. In November, five out of Richmond&#39;s seven council seats will be opening, including the mayor&rsquo;s seat, and that appears to be why they&rsquo;re plastering the town with billboards.</p>
<p class="p1">
	A company like Chevron is more than willing to spend all the money it can to ensure the operation of its biggest refinery in California. Whether it means starting a newspaper or sponsoring elections, they seem capable of doing anything necessary for their project. Chevron did not return my calls, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d have plenty of jargon about jobs and economic growth for me. There may be a lot of jobs in oil, but there aren&rsquo;t any jobs at all when the town you live in is on fire.</p>

	<em>Nathan Phelps (photo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Nate_Phelps,_speaking_at_the_Imagine_No_Religion_conference_in_Kamloops,_BC,_May_7,_2011.jpg" target="_blank">via</a>)</em></p>
<p>
	Westboro Baptist Church founder and world-famous bastard Fred Phelps <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/fred-phelps-has-died">died last week</a>&mdash;and it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;ll be missed even by a large part of his large family (he had&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps" target="_blank">13 children and 54 grandchildren</a>), who still make up <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/24/pastor-fred-phelps-westboro-baptist-church-louis-theroux" target="_blank">a large part of what remains of the WBC</a>.</p>
<p>
	So far, more than <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/god-hates-fags-preacher-fred-phelps-founder-of-the-infamous-westboro-baptist-church-dies-9205898.html" target="_blank">20 members</a> of the Phelps family have left the church due to his behavior and WBC&#39;s practices. One of them is Nathan Phelps, who left the Kansas family house at 18, accusing his father of, among other things,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9913463/My-father-the-hate-preacher-Nate-Phelps-on-escaping-Westboro-Baptist-Church.html" target="_blank">child abuse</a>. Having completely denounced the WBC dogma, Nathan now lives in Canada, calls himself an atheist, and is an avid supporter of LGBT rights. He has also spent the past few years giving speeches and interviews about his experience as a member of WBC.</p>
<p>
	Back in 2012, I had the honor of having Nate stay as a guest in my house for a few days. Once I heard about his father&#39;s death, and with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NatePhelps/posts/10151924300961765?stream_ref=5" target="_blank">Facebook announcement</a> Nate made about it in mind, I got in touch with him again.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: Hey, Nate. How do you feel about your dad dying?<br />
	Nathan Phelps: </strong>I haven&#39;t seen my father in over 35 years. I spoke to him once, briefly, in 1995. Ten years after I left home, I went through a deliberate mourning process for the loss of my family. Between that and the passage of time, I believed I would have no feelings when he passed. I was surprised that there were feelings when I learned of his condition and then his death. I&#39;ve now had a few days to consider those feelings, and I think the sadness is over what might have been.</p>
<p>
	<strong>When you revealed that your father was dying a few days ago, you said family members that left the church were being blocked from seeing him. If you had been able to, would you have wanted to see him one last time in person?</strong><br />
	In a perfect world, I would have jumped at that chance. I left that place 37 years ago as a fearful young man. The absence of interaction, an opportunity to process that, only means I still have that fear to contend with. If there were the least bit of evidence that our relationship had changed in his eyes, I would be there in a heartbeat. Other than that, my greatest concern was for my family members who had expressed a desire to see him and were being denied that opportunity.</p>
<!--recommended--><p>
	<strong>So far, that famous Facebook update of yours from a few days ago has 2,000 comments. I read quite a few of them, and there seemed to be a divide between those who wanted to leave comments celebrating his death and those that felt this would be disrespectful to you as his son&mdash;even likening it to picketing a funeral. Given that you were one of his biggest critics while he was alive, what are your thoughts on this?</strong><br />
	They [the WBC] have done great harm to many people. I cannot expect all of them to be prepared to forgive and forget just because he stopped breathing. Having said that, I don&#39;t condone fighting hate with hate. I am fond of something the British philosopher Bertrand Russell said near the end of his life: &quot;The moral thing I should like to say is, love is wise and hatred is foolish.&quot; These are not interesting words on a sign, but a way of approaching life and other humans morally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>You sometimes tweet at your sister Shirley. Does she or any of the other family members who are still in the church ever respond to or communicate with you?</strong><br />
	Rarely, but I&#39;ve heard from most of them at one time or another. The interesting thing about those encounters is that we discover quite early on that we have no basis for debate because I roundly reject the foundation for their entire worldview, the divine inerrancy of the Bible.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You revealed that your father had been excommunicated a few months ago by the church he founded. Do you know if this was an indication of any significant changes at the WBC? What do you think will become of it now?</strong><br />
	This is tough to answer with any certainty. I&#39;ve heard he was kicked out because his personality had changed, and he was treating the family and other church members cruelly. You will allow me to pause for a moment of bitter laughter at that one. That rationale should have seen him excommunicated 60 years ago. But I digress. The other thing I heard is that he was at odds with a newly formed board of eight elders regarding the direction of the church and this led to his excommunication.</p>
<p>
	Having said that, it&#39;s not clear if it was a complete excommunication or a forced removal from his position as pastor. Some things I&#39;ve heard from family members suggest that they turned their back on him in the end. Other comments lead me to believe that he was still, in their eyes, in good standing with God.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What effect do you think his death will have on the family? Do you foresee it changing any of their relationships with you?</strong><br />
	I won&#39;t hold my breath. I do believe that the new dynamics will be very, very difficult to sustain. There is evidence that an outsider, Steve Drain, holds significant power. That same power in my father&#39;s hands encompassed so much more than Steve could ever match. If they keep bleeding young members from their flock, I have to believe they will reach a tipping point that will fracture what&#39;s left. Stay tuned.</p>

<title>What Really Happened During Mexico City&#039;s Airport Shoot-Out?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/what-really-happened-during-mexico-citys-airport-shootout</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144711/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-11-35-12-AM.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Deputy Chief Luis Cardenas Palomino at his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZdVKqCSEw">press conference</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	At 8:33 in the morning on Monday, June 25, 2012, the sound of gunfire erupted in Terminal 2 of the Mexico City International Airport. The shots were coming from the direction of the food court. Witnesses recalled seeing two separate groups of gunmen, both clad in the dark navy uniforms of the Mexican Federal Police. Travelers and airport personnel dived for cover underneath the neat rows of small round tables.</p>
<p>
	Altogether, three policemen died at the scene, according to the Federal Public Safety Department, whose uniforms all of the shooters in question were wearing. The two men dressed as police but designated as villains fled the airport on foot.</p>
<p>
	The shoot-out at the Mexico City International Airport remains one of the most singularly bizarre, alarming, and, above all, unexplained events of the drug war.</p>
<p>
	Among the dead was the bodyguard to the chief of federal police at the airport, the shift supervisor for land transportation at the terminal, and a patrolmen on duty that morning. The Federal Police were unsure whether the men responsible for their deaths were police, ex-police, or impostors. They were later identified as two patrolmen, dirty cops, the chief said, caught red-handed in a drug deal involving an anonymous network of cocaine traffickers based in Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>
	Apart from the body count, almost nothing about the official version stands up. The deputy chief of the Federal Public Safety Department, Luis Cardenas Palomino, attributed the shoot-out to a satchel of drugs hidden in an airport men&#39;s room. When one of the dirty cops brought it out, that was the signal to move in for the arrest. So then why did 44 minutes elapse on the time-stamped video from the time that a blurry figure is pictured entering a restroom to the moment that a nondescript figure is pictured at the top of the stairs where he will be detained? Why is the satchel of drugs not clearly pictured in any of the still images presented as evidence? Where did it go when the suspects ran away, their arms unencumbered?</p>
<p>
	It was a drug deal with no evidence of drugs; a special operations team of three officers, all of whom ended up dead; a special operation every moment of which somehow eluded the 430 security cameras filming every inch of the airport at the time, without the knowledge of the airport security personnel who monitored them.</p>
<p>
	Last week, members of the airport&#39;s video-surveillance team leaked never-before-seen footage of the shoot-out to the Mexican news weekly <em>Reporte Indigo</em>. The new footage exposes Deputy Chief Palomino and the Federal Public Safety Department for selectively choosing video and still images to substantiate the story&mdash;of a special operation of good cops busting bad cops&mdash;that they wanted to transmit to the public.</p>
<p>
	The new footage shows that Deputy Chief Palomino hid from the public the fact that a second shoot-out occurred in the airport only about a minute after the two patrolmen had already fled. <em>Reporte Indigo </em>cited anonymous sources close to the investigation who believed the patrolman was most likely killed during the second shoot-out, when the suspects were out of the building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The footage from 2012 shows the two shooters escaping through the food court at 8:33 AM. In his presentation to the media, Deputy Chief Palomino stops the tape there, at the point time-stamped 8:34:30. The last movements are of terror-stricken patrons of the food court beginning to pick themselves up off the floor. By choosing to stop the footage there, it gives the appearance that the violence was over.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144718/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-11-58-45-AM.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">A still from the security footage used by Deputy Chief Palomino</span></em></p>
<p>
	The new footage, however, continues rolling past that point where the deputy chief had stopped the tape. A mere six seconds later, bullets fly in the food court once again.</p>
<p>
	What did The Federal Public Safety Department have to gain by hiding the fact of a second shoot-out? Certainly, the notion that one group of police was secretly planning to arrest the other could not have survived otherwise. A closer look at the new footage also reveals that more Federal Police were involved in the shoot-outs, and the operation appears larger and more premeditated than previously thought.</p>
<p>
	The new footage introduces previously unknown characters into leading roles in the shoot-outs. Two unidentified federal police officers appear in one new scene. They are shown leaning against a railing in a busy passageway between the food court and the gates for international flights. It is only a few minutes before the first shoot-out will begin. A civilian wearing a ski mask approaches and greets them, shaking hands. He then crosses to the other side of the busy passageway and greets others at the edge of the frame before disappearing off camera.</p>
<p>
	The officers display a nonchalance that amounts to a kind of premeditation. Moments before the shooting commences, one of the policemen moves away from the railing and walks over to within a few yards of where the first shots are fired. As panic sets in, and the travelers and employees of the airport are seen running for their lives, the second officer moves without haste to a large screen in the middle of the frame, which he steps behind and which blocks the camera&#39;s view of him. His partner returns showing no sign of panic, and both men can be seen speaking on their cell phones as they observe the unfolding action. Neither of them so much as unholsters his firearm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A similar figure appears immediately after the second shoot-out in the food court. He is another federal policeman, emerging briefly from a hiding place behind a giant decorative potted plant in the middle of the seating area. Like the others hiding behind the screen, this man seems to be aware of where the security cameras are. He too is seen speaking deliberately into a cell phone, emerging from hiding only momentarily to assess the scene. When a detachment of federal police arrive on camera, they patrol away from the direction in which the shots were fired, rather than toward it.</p>
<p>
	A week after their escape, the two patrolmen accused of gunning down three of their fellow police reached out to the Mexican news magazine <em>Proceso </em>to tell their version of the story. Daniel Cruz and Zeferino Morales admitted guilt in the deaths, but denied they were involved in drug trafficking.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And we know that we are going to pay for that, but we cannot acknowledge the other charges because we never got involved in drug trafficking,&rdquo; Cruz said. &ldquo;It is very clear who protected drug trafficking and who provided the protections. [The deceased policemen] always used to say that they got along well with Chief Palomino and that they had it all on a silver platter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So what are we to make of all this? A quick rundown of the recent criminal history at the airport is enough to suggest that the shoot-out most likely arose from a dispute between rival cliques of corrupt police over the spoils of drug trafficking. As recently as 2008, the then-chief of the federal police, Edgar Millan, was shot to death in his home in Mexico City. One of the suspects was a former anti-narcotics police officer at the airport, and he had in his possession a notebook with detailed information about drug trafficking there.</p>
<p>
	Less than a year before the shoot-out, a pilot with Aeromexico was caught at Madrid&#39;s airport with 92 pounds of cocaine in his personal luggage. Eight months prior to that, three flight attendants with Aeromexico were caught with more than 300 pounds of cocaine between them. A company providing private security at checkpoints in Mexico City International Airport were also arrested in connection with that case.</p>
<p>
	The airport is known as a transshipment hub for South American cocaine headed to Europe, as well as a recipient of bulk cash deliveries from the United States.</p>
<p>
	Officers Cruz and Morales remain fugitives. They said they would turn themselves in when there is a&nbsp; change in the presidential administration. That change happened in December, but neither man has been heard from. The reward for their capture is around half a million dollars. The third man, their shift supervisor, whom they said had nothing to do with the airport shoot-out, was captured and charged on July 15, 2012. In August, 348 federal police officers at the Mexico City International Airport were replaced and reassigned to other states.</p>
<p>
	The replacements were police officers who passed a double scrutiny, and an exhaustive vetting process, according to a statement that Chief Palomino made at the time. But only time will tell when the next scandal&mdash;or shoot-out&mdash;occurs.</p>

<title>CAN-FAP Is Fighting for Foreskins Everywhere</title>

	<br />
	<em><span class="photo_caption">CAN-FAP leader Glen Callender. All photos courtesy of James Loewen via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/james.loewen.75/media_set?set=a.10151975168281937.1073741860.649731936&amp;type=1" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	The majority of the Western world has already come to the conclusion that female genital mutilation is bad&mdash;it&rsquo;s brutal, invasive, and causes children unbelievable amounts of pain for no reason. Meanwhile, male genital mutilation, a.k.a. circumcision, is hailed as a great way to prevent everything from venereal diseases to cancer. The benefits of circumcision are still being debated, so medical associations refrain from condemning or supporting the practice for the most part, and generally leave the decision up to a child&rsquo;s parents. But plenty of anti-circumcision activists want the procedure banned altogether, like the Canadian organization called <a href="http://www.can-fap.net/" target="_blank">CAN-FAP</a>, which stands for the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project.</p>
<p>
	The foreskin-loving group organized a protest last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, during a TED Talk featuring Bill and Melinda Gates. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/HIV#bodyregion_0_interiorarticle_0_strategysections_2_strategysubsections003d5bb5b7d94917b0e1fc15987e4745_3_lnkHeader" target="_blank">donating millions of dollars</a> to programs that offer circumcision in Africa as a preventative measure against HIV, which has led CAN-FAP to dub Bill Gates &ldquo;Foreskin Enemy #1.&rdquo; I caught up with Glen Callender, the organization&#39;s founder, to ask him what he was thinking when he named his organization, among other things.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: First off, what&rsquo;s with the name, CAN-FAP?</strong><br />
	<strong>Glen Callender</strong>: Well, a lot of people seem to think it&rsquo;s a mistake. But of course it&rsquo;s deliberate, and it&rsquo;s a reference to the history of circumcision in the Western world. It began as a non-religious surgery in the 1800s to primarily prevent boys from masturbating. The foreskin is, of course, a built-in masturbation aid, and that&rsquo;s the way nature intended it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did CAN-FAP get started?<br />
	</strong>I started CAN-FAP in June 2010. The main motivation for it was that I have a really enjoyable foreskin. My foreskin actually has its own orgasms, and it feels fantastic every day of my life. When I was a kid and I learned about circumcision for the first time, I already had a very good relationship with my foreskin, and the idea horrified me. That horror has never left my system&mdash;just knowing that little boys are being strapped down and having this valuable, enjoyable part of their penis cut off. The men who have foreskins know that it&rsquo;s a good body part, it&rsquo;s valuable, and that there aren&rsquo;t bad parts of the penis. This is an ancient, religious, superstitious idea. There are no bad parts of the penis, and there are no bad parts of the female vulva. It&rsquo;s all good, and we shouldn&rsquo;t be tampering with the sexuality of children and the adults they grow up to be. We understand, because we&rsquo;re not accustomed to it, that female genital mutilation of any kind is child abuse. You&rsquo;re taking a sharp object, and you&rsquo;re deliberately causing pain and bleeding and amputation to a child&rsquo;s genitals. Well, we do the same thing with boys, and we need to stop doing it. Knives and genitals of children should have nothing to do with each other. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl or if you cut a little or a lot&mdash;taking a knife to the genitals of a child is sexual abuse.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Are there any health benefits to circumcision?</strong><br />
	The circumcision rate in some countries is less than 1 percent, so if circumcision improves men&rsquo;s sexual health, we would see men getting sick in Europe because of their foreskins. But it turns out that the sexual health of intact European men and their female partners is as good as or better than the sexual health of their circumcised counterparts. It&rsquo;s really bullshit. It&rsquo;s all about making parents scared so they&rsquo;ll hand over their babies to be circumcised so doctors can make their money. They know if a boy grows up, when he&rsquo;s 18 years old, there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s going to want a knife near his penis, because any man would be crazy to want less penis.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s like, if you saw them plucking out a kid&rsquo;s eye, you would be horrified because you have an eye and you know how wonderful an eye is. But then you have the parents saying, &ldquo;No, no, no, we come from a religion that believes that there&rsquo;s one evil eye, and you pluck that eye out! And it&rsquo;s fine having one eye; you can still see.&rdquo; And you go, &quot;Shut up! You&rsquo;re plucking out a kid&rsquo;s eye and taking away a sense organ from him. You&rsquo;re taking away part of his body that he uses to interact with the world and enjoy life.&quot; I feel the same way about my foreskin. I have a foreskin, and frankly, that makes it clear that all the arguments for circumcision are bullshit.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144427/canfap2-000.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 410px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>Can you tell me why you&rsquo;re calling Bill Gates &ldquo;Foreskin Enemy #1&quot;?</strong><br />
	Through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates has committed over $145 million to circumcising as many African men and boys as possible. And there are hints that they might actually be prepared to spend up to a billion dollars on this, as these programs scale up in different countries. That makes Bill Gates personally responsible for more unnecessary circumcisions than any other individual in the world. He has exterminated more foreskin than anybody else, and that is why he is Foreskin Enemy #1. It&rsquo;s just an embarrassment in the 21st century&mdash;the idea that we should be making up reasons to cut off healthy, normal parts of people&#39;s bodies is insane.</p>
<p>
	The studies that Bill Gates uses as a basis for this funding really make circumcision look good. The results show a 50 to 70 percent reduction in HIV transmission over a short period of time, and that&rsquo;s the thing in some cases: Even if it works, it&rsquo;s over a short period of time, not long-term. The bottom line here is that real-world populations don&rsquo;t reflect that data. If circumcision really did prevent VDs, population data would consistently show that circumcised populations had fewer VDs than the intact, but that&rsquo;s not the case. The United States proves this within its own borders. They had the biggest HIV epidemic in the Western world there among an almost completely circumcised male population.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144428/canfap3.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>Why did people start messing with penises in the first place?</strong><br />
	It started out as a preventative measure against masturbation, because they believed in Victorian times that masturbation caused all sorts of health problems. Then it became used as prevention against venereal diseases, then cancer&mdash;they always make it [a cure for] whatever the scary thing is. Today it&rsquo;s HIV, so lo and behold, circumcision prevents HIV! And in the future, if a new venereal disease emerges that we haven&rsquo;t yet heard of, well, they&rsquo;ll say that circumcision prevents that too. But really, for cultural and religious and financial reasons, they want to cut off your foreskin. It is a billion-dollar industry in the US: About 3,000 boys a day are circumcised, and that earns pediatricians over a billion dollars a year. And there are billions more in hospitals, and the fact that foreskins get sold into the biotech industry and get used to create skin grafts and used to create collagen and other ingredients for beauty creams&mdash;the bottom line here is that this is not an ethical industry.</p>
<p>
	And what a coincidence that the part that&rsquo;s being cut off is on the most enjoyable part of your body. You know, God doesn&rsquo;t want a knuckle, or the index toe off of one of your feet, or a bit of your earlobe, no. He wants part of your penis. Your genitals are supposed to be your happy place, and religion wants to make them your unhappy place, your shame place.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You do something called the </strong><strong><a href="http://www.can-fap.net/sra/sra.shtml" target="_blank">Foreskin Pride Salute</a>. C</strong><strong>an you explain it?</strong><br />
	Explain it? Well, first of all, you can&rsquo;t have a circumcised T-shirt. You&rsquo;ve got to have a long-sleeved shirt that goes all the way down to your wrists. And you make a fist with your hand, which symbolizes the head of the penis, and you tuck that fist away into the sleeve of your shirt and heroically extend your arm skyward and pull back that sleeve to reveal the fist. And that is very symbolic. I hope that intact men around the world will adopt the Foreskin Pride Salute to show the world that intact men are proud of our foreskins and we love them. The problem is in your head, not on my penis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Anything else to add?</strong><br />
	I&rsquo;d like to add that black foreskin is beautiful.</p>

<title>New York City Politics Is Still a Bunch of Warring Ethnic Tribes</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/nyc-politics-still-bunch-warring-ethnic-tribes</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144515/bill-de-blasio-tribes-vice.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, and a smattering of activists/elected officials at a &quot;unity rally&#39;&quot; last fall. Photo via Flickr user&nbsp;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tyreseus/" target="_blank">Jere Keys</a></i></p>
<p>
	Though he was seemingly invincible after cruising to a landslide win over a joker of a Republican opponent in November, nowadays Bill de Blasio, the onetime progressive messiah and current New York City mayor, is struggling. Polls <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/nyregion/de-blasios-approval-dips-though-his-personal-marks-remain-high.html?hpw&amp;rref=nyregion&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">show</a> his approval rating has sunk below 50 percent, and it&#39;s clear he&#39;s finding it impossible to satisfy the city&#39;s hodgepodge of competing ethnic factions and interest groups jockeying for influence. He&#39;s still polling relatively well among blacks and Hispanics, but whites are downright skeptical, with a plurality expressing pessimism about the city&rsquo;s future under the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/nyregion/a-mayoral-hopeful-now-de-blasio-was-once-a-young-leftist.html" target="_blank">Sandinista-in-chief</a>. So after a mayoral race that appeared to unite the city&mdash;de Blasio won more than 70 percent of the vote, the most of any candidate in decades&mdash;his most committed supporters are naturally a bit nervous that the <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/new-yorkers-welcome-bill-de-blasios-leftist-utopia" target="_blank">left-wing utopia</a> they were promised is in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>
	Some of the mayor&#39;s growing pains are natural given that his campaign was about calls for social progress, but his tenure so far has been full of the headaches inherent in mundane tasks like deciding whether or not to close city schools in anticipation of snow. Erstwhile fans of Barack Obama will recall how miserable the first few weeks of each term were, when the hope generated by his inspiring campaigns gave way to economic teams <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/big-moneys-obama" target="_blank">littered with alumni</a> of Wall Street megabanks. De Blasio, who has spent most of his career as a Democratic political strategist, is playing the game by the same rules as everyone else&mdash;so far, he&#39;s made shameless appeals to every tangible constituency while publicly saying <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/why-de-blasio-is-softening-on-charter-schools.html?mid=google" target="_blank">most of the right things</a> to soothe the powerful elites who look back fondly on the days of Michael Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704107204574472892886003298" target="_blank">luxury city</a>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He is doing exactly what he said he would do and for the constituency that elected him,&rdquo; said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran NYC Democratic political consultant. &ldquo;New York City politics was ethnic before it was racial, and it has always been tribal: groups in competition with each other for limited resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	(We recently got a refresher in this dynamic from a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/nyregion/they-kept-a-lower-east-side-lot-vacant-for-decades.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> investigation</a> that showed how Sheldon Silver, now the speaker of the state Assembly, blocked affordable housing for decades in a temporarily successful bid to preserve the Jewish identity of the Lower East Side&mdash;and with it, his own political power.)</p>
<p>
	Beloved by minorities and white liberals, de Blasio was never going to keep three quarters of America&rsquo;s largest city happy, not with an ambitious reform agenda that has already produced one of the more progressive paid-sick-leave laws in the country, which the mayor <a href="http://observer.com/2014/03/bill-de-blasio-signs-his-first-bill-at-brooklyn-ice-cream-factory/" target="_blank">signed</a> triumphantly at an artisanal ice cream factory in Brooklyn last week. Its beneficiaries will <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/poor-and-hispanic-workers-are-least-likely-to-have-sick-days/284232/" target="_blank">overwhelmingly</a><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/poor-and-hispanic-workers-are-least-likely-to-have-sick-days/284232/" target="_blank"> </a>be black and Latino, and the same goes for de Blasio&#39;s universal, government-funded pre-kindergarten initiative, which <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/state-senate-proposes-540-million-pre-k-plan-article-1.1721208" target="_blank">appears likely</a> to come to fruition (albeit not by way of taxing the rich, as the mayor hoped) after months of maneuvering by Governor Andrew Cuomo and state legislators in Albany.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, one group the mayor has yet to deliver any real goods for is the city&#39;s Muslim community, which was <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/ray-kellys-path-to-becoming-americas-big-brother" target="_blank">systematically surveilled</a> by the NYPD under Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Ray Kelly. We still don&#39;t know what will become of New York&#39;s global anti-terrorism apparatus: John Miller, the former journalist and press flack whom current police commissioner Bill Bratton tapped to head up the department&rsquo;s Intelligence Division, <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/03/8542459/brattons-lament-sympathetic-council" target="_blank">told</a> the City Council last week that he was having a hard time getting a handle on his new domain.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To be honest with you, when I said I want to see our policies for intelligence collections and investigations, it was hard to get a hold of them. When I finally got them, [the manual] stood a foot tall,&rdquo; Miller said when asked about Muslim surveillance. He suggested that an internal review of surveillance practices would take months to complete. In the meantime, an NYPD inspector general will be named in a matter of weeks, offering the prospect of at least some kind of police oversight. Even with that delay, Muslim and Arab American advocates who supported de Blasio&#39;s campaign are heartened by conspicuous outreach from Bratton and his deputies&mdash;they never got that kind of attention under Bloomberg.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So far, they&rsquo;re putting the lie to the idea that you can either have a safe city or a decent one,&rdquo; said Eugene O&rsquo;Donnell, a former Brooklyn cop and prosecutor who advised de Blasio&rsquo;s campaign on criminal justice policy and was involved in his transition this winter.</p>
<p>
	But balancing concern for the groups traditionally on the fringe of city life with the need to avoid upsetting more powerful interests like Brooklyn&#39;s massive and politically influential Orthodox Jewish community (which de Blasio has been <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/149311/de-blasio-ultra-orthodox-support" target="_blank">courting</a> for decades) will be tricky. There are a handful of Orthodox operatives with prominent roles in his administration, but so far, at least, no visible presence for Muslim or Arab Americans with the exception of Sherif Soliman, former communications director for the NYC Employees&#39; Retirement System, who was chosen to act as the mayor&#39;s voice in Albany (which speaks to a desire to reassure conservatives in the Orthodox world more than anything else).</p>
<p>
	&quot;Many of those who feared a bomb-throwing radical have been pleasantly surprised by his appointments,&quot; said David Luchins, a professor at Touro College in Manhattan and an expert on the city&#39;s Orthodox community.</p>
<p>
	You can&#39;t keep everyone happy all of the time, however, and de Blasio has quickly made his share of outright enemies. Charter-school advocates like former councilwoman&nbsp;<a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/01/8539382/what-now-eva-moskowitz" target="_blank">Eva Moskowitz</a>&nbsp;think he&#39;s on a quest to destroy them on behalf of his allies in local teachers&#39; unions. Everyone from actor Liam Neeson to the AFL-CIO is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/de-blasio-s-horse-drawn-carriage-ban-faces-hurdles-1.7441812" target="_blank">miffed</a>&nbsp;at his insistence on banning horse-drawn carriages. And a botched handling of one of this winter&#39;s many storms&nbsp;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/01/upper-east-side-ny-post-bully-de-blasio.html" target="_blank">nearly sent</a>&nbsp;the Upper East Side into outright rebellion&mdash;and provided the right-wing <em>New York Post</em>, which accused de Blasio of <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/71761/bill-de-blasio-s-a-commie-claims-super-reputable-new-york-post" target="_blank">being a commie</a> during the campaign, with another chance to call him incompetent.</p>
<p>
	His low approval ratings are likely frustrating to de Blasio&#39;s team, because New Yorkers actually <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-steep-learning-curve-article-1.1714716" target="_blank">agree with him on most issues</a>. The easy part, they&#39;re finding out, was getting their guy elected&mdash;the hard part is figuring out how to force everyone to get along.</p>

<title>This Death Row Inmate Is Dying to Donate His Organs</title>

<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144442/longo-.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 499px;" /></p>
<p>
	In 2001 Christian Longo killed his wife and his three young children and fled to Mexico. Once he was brought back to the US, he was convicted of those murders and placed on Oregon&rsquo;s Death Row, where he has resided since 2003. He was <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-today-placed-christian-michael-longo-on-its-ten-most-wanted-fugitives-list" target="_blank">once on</a> the FBI&#39;s top-ten most wanted list, and James Franco is even going to play him in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/business/media/true-story-is-based-on-the-conning-of-a-shamed-journalist.html?ref=christianmichaellongo&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">an upcoming movie</a>.</p>
<p>
	Christian, now 40 and still in jail, is turning a new leaf. In an effort to give back to his community, he has decided to donate his organs upon his inevitable execution. The only problem is, due to the lack of an efficient prisoner donation protocol, he pretty much can&#39;t. Chris is even willing to forgo all appeals of his death sentence if he can donate his organs upon his execution. Still, he&#39;s been denied.</p>
<p>
	Through his Gifts of Anatomical Value from Everyone (<a href="http://www.gavelife.org/">G.A.V.E</a>) organization, Chris is looking to change that. The mission of G.A.V.E is to remove the medical and ethical issues involved with prisoner organ and tissue donation and gain approval for some of the 2 million incarcerated individuals to donate. If successful, the organization will substantially reduce the number of people on waiting lists for organ and tissue donation (which is <a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/" target="_blank">more than 121,000</a>,&nbsp;according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network).</p>
<p>
	I recently conducted an email interview with Longo about how he came to found G.A.V.E, the work his organization is doing, and the impact prisoner donation could have if certain ethical and political barriers were removed.</p>

<p>
	<strong>VICE: What piqued your interest in prisoner organ donation?</strong><br />
	<strong>Christian Longo: </strong>After watching a friend increasingly suffer from a degenerative disorder called scleroderma, it became apparent she would eventually need a kidney transplant. After being told by my prison system that consideration may only be given for donations to immediate family, I put together a proposal for my unique circumstances as a death row inmate. I offered to end my remaining appeals and face execution if my healthy body parts were able to be donated to those in need. My request was denied.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How surprising was it to find out you couldn&rsquo;t donate?</strong><br />
	It was a Spockian &quot;that&#39;s illogical&quot; moment followed by a fear that someone I cared about might not be able to find a suitable donor... which pissed me off.</p>
<p>
	<strong>When and why was the ban of prisoner donations instituted?</strong><br />
	It&#39;s not a ban per se, but there&#39;s enough red tape that it might as well be. Due to inadequate testing, infections such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C were being transplanted with the organs. Prisoners along with gay men, hemophiliacs, and intravenous-drug users were all listed in the CDC&#39;s <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031670.htm" target="_blank">donor exclusion recommendations</a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What&#39;s changed since?</strong><br />
	In 1994, the risk of contracting HIV was <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00040737.htm" target="_blank">much greater</a>&nbsp;in prison than it was for the general US population. I think the problem lies in testing methods. In the early 90s testing procedures were unable to detect the virus accurately. Now we have RNA testing, which can detect the virus within days of infection.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who allows prisoners to sign up to donate organs? Any prisoner donations yet?</strong><br />
	Utah became the first state <a href="http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/13/17674231-new-utah-law-allows-organ-donations-from-prisoners-nearly-250-sign-up?lite" target="_blank">to legislate</a> the right of prisoners to be donors last year, and they now give inmates the opportunity to register as donors upon entry to prison. To date, about 1,000 of the 7,000 prisoners in Utah&#39;s correctional system have signed up. Texas and Maricopa County, Arizona, also allow prisoners to register as donors.</p>
<p>
	Thus far, I&#39;m not aware of any registered inmates who have donated. The problem has been that even in states that technically allow donation, they only allow donations after death. Prison security issues slow this process down prohibitively, to a point of death for the organs... and any hopeful recipient. Until prison policies are adjusted accordingly, living donation opportunities, like kidneys and bone marrow, have to be considered.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What about societal aversion to donations from prisoners? And is that present on the recipient level?</strong><br />
	Unofficial polls <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388804/#R9" target="_blank">reflect</a> that over 70 percent of respondents feel that prisoners should be able to donate. I encourage anyone to swing by any local dialysis clinic to ask if they would accept an inmate&#39;s organ, even one on death row.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are the ethical and medical risks, if any, for these types of procedures?</strong><br />
	Certainly, the care that can be taken to screen a confined prisoner is much greater than that of, say, an accident victim whose organs must be procured quickly. Ethically, so long as a prisoner is given the same counseling as non-prison donors, ensuring appropriate consent&mdash;the biggest gripe of ethicists&mdash;any ethical issues are easily resolved.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is informed consent a real concern regarding prisoner donation?</strong><br />
	The medical community and prison systems are still sore from the 70s, when it became apparent that <a href="http://www.prisonexp.org/" target="_blank">prisoners were being used for medical experimentation</a>. Even though prisoners were &quot;volunteering,&quot; there was a paid incentive. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that organ and tissue donation be offered without perks. No parole considerations. No pay. Not even special visitation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How many lives could be saved using the organs of executed prisoners?</strong><br />
	First off, organs and tissue from the nearly 2 million non&ndash;death row inmates would make the greatest dent by far, but the numbers of lives that could be saved by the executed are not insubstantial or insignificant. There are currently about <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmates-state-and-size-death-row-year" target="_blank">3,100 prisoners on death row</a> in the US. There are about 45 executions per year, with roughly 1,400 executions since lethal injection was first used. Recent surveys have shown that roughly 80 percent of death row inmates would donate after their execution if given the option.</p>
<p>
	With a planned execution, you can maximize the amount of viable transplants and have recipients at the ready for every part&mdash;one heart, one pancreas, two kidneys, two lungs, two liver lobes, and up to 50 other transplantable parts. This could save or, at the very least, severely improve the lives of hundreds of people every year.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What about those who can&#39;t separate your past from your current mission?</strong><br />
	I agree with the &quot;gifts of a bad man bring no good with them&quot; rationale unless that man can give in a way that does nothing to benefit him. A horrible past does not preclude positive acts, like a fight to donate healthy parts. However, I agree that I&#39;m not the best person to tackle this issue. I was torn for years about how loud to shout. I&#39;m a distraction. My presence adds unnecessary questions to the debate, like this one.</p>
<p>
	Worse, it stirs up the pain of those I&#39;ve hurt. I would like nothing more than to quietly donate, even if it means facing my sentence to do so.</p>

<title>&#039;Porn Studies&#039; Is a Serious Academic Journal for Serious Academics</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/porn-studies-is-a-serious-academic-journal-for-serious-academics</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 14:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144690/SexyTeacher.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 321px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Screencap via YouTube uploader <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGOSs0BBWdo" target="_blank">sameesha1000</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rprn20/current#.UzD5PmRdU4P" target="_blank"><em>Porn Studies</em></a>, the &quot;first dedicated, international, peer-reviewed journal to critically explore those cultural products and services designated as pornographic,&quot; launched on Friday, and it&#39;s currently free. For a limited time, non-academics like you and me can peruse it and try to wrap our quivering brains around some hot, throbbing knowledge before a paywall gets draped over all the best parts.</p>
<p>
	The time was evidently right for the study of porn to take another step toward recognition as an academic field, with not just a journal but also a <a href="http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/2014_conference/scms2014_onlineprogram.pdf">workshop</a>&nbsp;called &quot;the Pedagogy of Pornography&quot; slated for the Society for Film and Media Studies&#39; 2014 conference in Seattle. Such conferences don&#39;t exactly attract media attention, and so there was no public titillation when the giants of porn studies got together for an all-star show. I contacted them to find out how it went.</p>
<p>
	But first, check out all the action at the journal&#39;s <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rprn20/current#.UzD5PmRdU4P" target="_blank">website</a>. You&nbsp;can get unfettered access, not just to thumbnails but to <em>full-length </em>essays with titles like &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2013.859465#.UzD6GGRdU4M">Humanities and Social Scientific Research Methods in Porn Studies</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.882646#.UzD6H2RdU4M" target="_blank">Positionality and Pornography</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzD6c2RdU4M" target="_blank">Authenticity and Its Role Within Feminist Pornography</a>,&quot; and my personal fave, &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzD6c2RdU4M">Deep Tags: Toward a Quantitative Analysis of Online Pornography</a>.&quot; And if you prefer your quantitative analysis completely raw-dog, here&#39;s a link to a spreadsheet of the <a href="http://pornstudies.sexualitics.org/data/xhamster.json.tar.gz" target="_blank">entire dataset</a> from the study. Kinda freaky, but, ya know, some people are into that shit.</p>
<p>
	The journal itself is published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_%26_Francis" target="_blank">Taylor &amp; Francis</a>, a 200-year-old British publishing company that lends gravitas to any such title, and it is perhaps this fact that attracted anti-porn activists to take notice and get their hackles up. After all, even though the journal is a compendium of MLA-formatted essays with proper parenthetical citations, and even though it&#39;s intended for consumption more or less exclusively by tweedy academics, there&#39;s international controversy afoot.</p>
<p>
	I guess that shouldn&#39;t really surprise me, because, after all, the journal discusses videos of naked people fucking.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144453/Screenshot-2014-03-25-10-03-46.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 369px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Gail Dines, screencapped from Youtube user&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ8yrS-fFh0">PublicChristianity</a></i></p>
<p>
	You see, there&#39;s a debate about the ethics of pornography that goes beyond famous battles such as <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt</em>, and <em>Mom vs. 17-Year-Old Son</em>, and when a publication like the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/porn-studies-journal-publishes-its-first-issue-9209885.html" target="_blank">Independent</a></em> in the UK writes about it, that&#39;s their angle. Publications looking for someone to at least sound eloquent and rational tend to look no further than Gail Dines, who also pens <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/stop-porn-culture-those-who-watch-modern-porn-are-becoming-increasingly-desensitised-9195395.html">editorials</a> for the<em>&nbsp;Independent. </em>Their article gives her a platform to say things like &quot;These editors come from a pro-porn background,&quot; implying that a more objective journal would take a very explicitly &quot;anti-porn&quot; approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Dines began as a feminist, and I suppose she remains one to this day, but in the 1970s and 80s&nbsp;there was a schism over how to regard sex in a world informed by feminism. During this era, called&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Sex_Wars">The Sex Wars</a>, many feminist friendships and professional associations ended. Dines formed a makeshift coalition with the religious right, and to this day, she writes books and gives interviews about how harmful porn is. Let it not be said that Dines&#39; writing never includes hard numbers and facts. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/11/11/does-pornography-deserve-its-bad-rap/a-pornography-habit-destroys-relationships?pagewanted=all&amp;gwh=1D6A5CFB2DE848CAC811CB2FED18E66C&amp;gwt=regi"><em>New York Times</em> op-ed from 2012</a>,&nbsp;she wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		The most extensive peer-reviewed study in the past decade found that a majority of scenes from 50 top-rented porn movies contained physical and verbal abuse of female performers. Physical aggression&mdash;including spanking, open-hand slapping, and gagging&mdash;occurred in 88 percent of scenes, with expressions of verbal aggression&mdash;usually a man calling a woman derogatory names&mdash;in 48 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	No one who brings numbers to a debate can be wrong, right? I think we can all agree that, indeed, the lion&#39;s share of cisgendered, hetero porn lacks situations in which sensitive men focus on pleasing women. Porn is often a garish form of nightmare theater that repeatedly plays out the phallocentric fantasies of society&#39;s lowest common denominator. To put it another way, in porn:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		[...] Young women with crisp fake tans, long platinum blonde hair extensions, silicon breasts, and acrylic nails are fucking cocks that are artificially erect. They vocalize a performative sense of pleasure with moans and squeals as their male counterparts lead them through a formulaic equation of sexual positions that &lsquo;opens&rsquo; the penetrative action up to the camera for the viewer&#39;s pleasure&mdash;not their own. This assemblage of &lsquo;fast food&rsquo; pornographic sex continues until the female performer is instructed to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; an orgasm and receive a load of hot cum on her face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Any idea where I got that pull quote? From a <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzHNImRdU4N" target="_blank">paper</a> in&nbsp;<em>Porn Studies</em>, the very publication Dines staunchly opposes.</p>
<p>
	Dine&#39;s censorship rhetoric, as in her editorial, &quot;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/stop-porn-culture-those-who-watch-modern-porn-are-becoming-increasingly-desensitised-9195395.html">Stop Porn Culture</a>,&quot; allows for a publication called <em>Porn Studies</em>&nbsp;only if what&#39;s being studied is how to abolish it. However, with porn being consumed by approximately everyone, and there being, according to some estimates, as much as one entire internet of porn in existence, advocating for abolition doesn&#39;t seem as helpful as the apparent mission intuited by the editors, contributors, and readers of&nbsp;<em>Porn Studies</em>:&nbsp;to include pornography as a facet of what academics call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies" target="_blank">cultural studies</a>.</p>
<p>
	John Stadler, literature graduate student at Duke University, and one of the figures at the forefront of porn studies, explained this to me more fully in an email. &quot;Porn is a part of culture, and whether one likes it or not, it has and will continue to be a part of our culture throughout our lifetimes. It behooves us as a society to critically engage it without a predetermined agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Because of the whole &quot;without a predetermined agenda&quot; notion, he actually seemed hesitant to weigh in about anti-porn advocacy, since this kind of advocacy is just not part of his job description. When academia is working right (and admittedly it isn&#39;t always), people who have something interesting to say about an issue rise to prominence, and people who just have an ax to grind for one reason or another are relegated to TV talk shows and <em>New York Times</em> editorials.</p>
<p>
	For more on this aspect, I also got in touch with Dr. Constance Penley, one of the leaders in the field of porn studies, to get her take on the reaction to this new field. Penley is a professor of film and media studies at UC Santa Barbara, and one of the first people who ever studied cultural phenomena like fan fiction in an academic setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144451/Screenshot-2014-03-25-10-01-42.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Constance Penley, screencapped from the <a href="http://videos.huffingtonpost.com/women/feminist-constance-penley-on-obscenity-and-john-stagliano-326484497" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
	She told me that the publication of <em>Porn Studies</em> is just the tip of the iceberg for the field. &quot;2013 was the trifecta for porn studies,&quot; she said. In addition to the journal, there were other events she considered milestones like &quot;the release of <em><a href="http://thefeministpornbook.com/,">The Feminist Porn Book</a></em>, and the first annual Feminist Porn Conference.&quot; So while Gail Dines is being <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterNolan1109/status/448139433607307264" target="_blank">targeted</a> by men&#39;s rights advocates as the man-hater who wants to ruin everyone&#39;s fun, she clearly does not have the market cornered on feminism in pornography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Penley told me anti-porn advocates are hardly a blip on the intellectual radar of those in the field, saying, &quot;There isn&#39;t a pro- v. anti-porn argument among scholars but a protest of porn scholarship by anti-porn activists, some of whom try to pass for scholars, who don&#39;t like the scholarly literature&#39;s conclusions,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>
	In other words, <em>Porn Studies</em> will be &quot;pro-porn&quot; when an author has a positive takeaway, &quot;anti-porn&quot; when he or she doesn&#39;t, and probably, more often than not, ambivalent about porn as a whole. This means rather than a rehash of a debate from the old Sex Wars days, the debate can take place in print, every quarter, and it will be peer-reviewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Penley says the problem with advocates like Dines is that they help perpetuate a somewhat stifling culture within academia. &quot;Nearly 70 percent of the professorate is contingent, adjunct labor without the protection of academic freedom to do teaching and research on whatever the professor deems worthy and necessary. Adjunct faculty can&#39;t risk doing anything new, edgy, or nontraditional, anything that would raise controversy. This is a problem not just for porn studies, of course, but for all of humanities and social science scholarship.&quot;</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s hard for non-tenured faculty, whose jobs are not secure, to study anything controversial, because they might be fired when the media picks it up and makes it into something tabloid-worthy. Academia increasingly can&#39;t stand up to the power of bad PR. Donors are extremely susceptible to PR, and it&#39;s easier for a university to just ditch the faculty members causing controversy than to hire a decent branding firm in order to defend their scholarship, even when the scholarship is important and shouldn&#39;t have to be defended.</p>
<p>
	So what will the scholarship consist of? According to Stadler, it will consist, at least in part, of finding hidden complexity. &quot;Porn is often treated as though it were not complex,&quot; he says. &quot;The body has always been a site that has had to struggle to prove its relation to knowledge. That misunderstanding is one that deserves correction.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The body&#39;s &quot;relation to knowledge?&quot; If you can parse material written in academic-ese, there&#39;s about to be some heavy shit written about porn. Personally, I just hope I can keep up.</p>

<title>The LAPD Is Arresting Venice Hippies for Having Drum Circles</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/venice-beach-is-safe-for-now-thanks-to-eagle-soaring-chief</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144497/ChiefEagleWide.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 435px;" /></p>
<p>
	For Los Angeles locals, Venice has always been a both cheery and dirty daycation spot. The beach is filled with decades-old locals who are mostly leathery hippies, peacefully maintaining it as their own, plus a permanently homeless population just looking for a grassy spot to get drunk and nap.</p>
<p>
	Ever since the gangs of the 90s were priced out by techies and &quot;creative professionals&quot; creeping in from neighboring white-bread Santa Monica and yacht-bred Marina del Ray, there&rsquo;s been a calm, commercial peace with the police, allowing the street vendors to hawk their handmade wares.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144501/BeachCrowd.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the anything-goes, free-love vibe also attracts drug addicts and loud party boys looking to get fucked up, with no regard for cleanliness or spiritual enlightenment via drumming.</p>
<p>
	In 2012, I briefly lived in a coke dealer&rsquo;s unfinished house off the beach, so I knew the background police presence was nothing new, but new <a href="http://venice311.org/venice-boardwalk/boardwalk-vending-rules-information/lamc-42-15-boardwalk-ordinance/" target="_blank">ordinances on vending and excessive noise</a> have ended in a series of violent altercation between cops and locals at the infamous weekend drum circle. The most recent was on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-two-arrested-venice-beach-drum-circle-police-20140317,0,7832871.story" target="_blank">Sunday</a>, so I drove down to see what had changed.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144500/PoliceCruisersBeach.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	When I arrived, at 4:20 PM, the drumming was just picking up. Concentric circles of decreasing levels of involvement defined their participants. The final circle consisted of vulture-like SUVs in slow orbit around the celebration, picking off those drinking from glass bottles or sucking down blunts in plain sight.</p>
<p>
	I approached an officer idling in his car some 20 feet from the edge of the drum circle. He seemed more than willing to talk&mdash;friendly even&mdash;behind menacing wraparound shades while his partners prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144502/BeachArrest2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	I asked him if they expected a bigger police presence than normal: &ldquo;Oh, yeah,&rdquo; Officer Mark said. &ldquo;Last week, people got drunk and high and started throwing bottles at us when we shut down the drum circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The relatively recent noise ordinance allows the LAPD to stop the drumming, but in doing so it effectively pushes the crowd off the beach, despite their right to stay until midnight, sans &ldquo;excessive noise.&quot; Mark continued, &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re not allowed to smoke weed or drink alcohol, and you&rsquo;re definitely not allowed to throw glass at police officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144511/PoliceObservationBeach.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Something crackled over the radio, and Mark excused himself before gunning it toward the boardwalk. Three more SUVs whipped past me with their lights blaring, and some ten officers piled out to descend on a potentially homeless guy and his unleashed dog. Clearly, he was a local.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144499/BeachArrest.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	While two cops put him in handcuffs, the rest milled around. An artist building the Sphinx out of sand on the sidewalk told me it was just a couple dudes in an argument, nothing serious. Fights on Venice Beach are a regular occurrence, but the flurry of police out of seemingly nowhere felt new.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144509/SleepingPersonBeach.jpg" style="width: 428px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	The latest ordinances&mdash;and the increased police force&mdash;were bolstered by a wealthy community looking to preserve the cultural epicenter they&rsquo;d paid through the nose to live in, missing the point that the original community existed solely because of a lack of such ordinances. Hippies, performance artists, street vendors, and that guy on roller skates playing Hendrix see curfews and permits as antithetical to their very existence.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144503/ChiefBadge.jpg" style="width: 428px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	The previous lack of a police presence hinged on the cooperation of Venice&rsquo;s residents, the ringleader of which appeared to be an older orange-ish gentleman with long white hair and a matching beard. He was standing on an upturned metal barrel waving a &ldquo;Peace to All Nations&rdquo; flag, dancing and occasionally fist-bumping with similarly tanned locals.</p>
<p>
	The 66-year-old &quot;Eagle Soaring Chief&quot; of Venice Beach wore a security officer badge on his tattered, open shirt. He looked like he&rsquo;d been ripening in the sun for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144504/BeachWide.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	As a self-appointed ambassador to the people, the Chief says he&#39;s earned the right to peacefully regulate &ldquo;his&rdquo; beach, working with the locals to take care of problems the police either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t deal with. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;ll ban them from the beach. The police can&rsquo;t ban people; I can,&rdquo; the Chief of the Beach told me.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for 66 years; [the police] just showed up six days, six minutes ago. I don&rsquo;t blame them, and hey, I don&rsquo;t want alcoholics on this beach either. I don&rsquo;t want drug addicts on this beach. If I catch anybody fighting it&mdash;see my teeth? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re all knocked out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144505/PoliceBack.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	The Chief explained that the previous week&rsquo;s altercation was the result of three &ldquo;knucklehead&rdquo; drummers nobody knew, and that the police crackdown was in response to three plastic bottles thrown from the boardwalk, not glass.</p>
<p>
	Despite the encroaching presence of the LAPD, many of the locals seemed content with their presence, as it meant fewer drug addicts and troublemakers, although they too seemed oblivious to the effects of increased regulation.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144506/PoliceCars.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	For the next few hours till sundown, the crowd doubled in size, splitting into two interconnected circles. The Chief wandered around, smiling and laughing. Every hour another SUV would pull up to the crowd and empty a few officers onto the sand.</p>
<p>
	With 20 minutes to go, a half dozen officers surrounded the officer in charge, Sergeant Brian Gura. I asked him how many he had prepared, and he gestured toward the boardwalk: &ldquo;Enough. We want to avoid a repeat of last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144508/DSC03204.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before, but lining the boardwalk must have been at least 30 officers ready to grab the incoming crowd if things got ugly. As the sun dipped into the water, the cops on the beach piled into their cars and turned on the Christmas lights, driving slowly and deliberately towards the crowd.</p>
<p>
	The Chief waved toward the drummers and sliced his hand through the air as if to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done!&rdquo; A few other regulars did the same, and about half the crowd dispersed toward the boardwalk as Sergeant Gura exited his car, flanked by three officers, and made his way toward the still dancing center. He smiled as they cleared out.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144507/PoliceNighttime.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	One guy came up to them filming on his iPhone, demanding an explanation for the intimidating police tactics. Gura replied, &ldquo;I&#39;m not trying to intimidate you. You&#39;re just very short, and I&#39;m very tall; there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.&rdquo; People laughed; order had been restored. A few idiots kept shouting, &ldquo;TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144498/BeachSunset.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Back at the boardwalk, as police began to leave, a few stayed to talk and joke with the regulars. Tensions were gone, and the night was falling. The Chief came up behind me, put his hand on my shoulder, and pointed at the diminishing taillights. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; he said with an air of eternal hope. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutual.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Sex, Snow, and Cocaine: My Life As a Ski Resort &#039;Chalet Bitch&#039;</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/belle-de-neige-ski-underbelly</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 10:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144386/25150-10150166147915106-4735084-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><a href="http://belledeneige.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Belle de Neige</a> (&ldquo;Beautiful Snow&rdquo;, if you didn&rsquo;t take French) is a blog about what people who work at ski resorts get up to when they&rsquo;re not fixing snow blades, or delivering apr&egrave;s-ski drinks to Jemima Khan and whoever else goes on ski holidays. The writer just condensed a bunch of her blog posts into a book, so we asked her to condense her book back into a blog post. This is that.</em></p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;ve been blogging about all the unpalatable shit people get up to on ski seasons for five years. And I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve covered all the major bases: sex, ill-advised drug consumption, orgies, avalanches, immoral workplace behavior, rich delinquents, Russian prostitutes&mdash;everything you&#39;d expect when you mix young people with high altitudes. So wrapping that all up into one snappy article should be easy, right? All I need to do is reel off a few anecdotes involving undignified sexual encounters as a result of British teens exporting British drinking culture, and I&rsquo;m set.</p>
<p>
	But the problem is that I don&rsquo;t want to start out like that, because perpetuating bullshit myths is boring. And because not everyone behind the scenes of Europe&rsquo;s ski resorts are Harrovian drop-outs or braying packs of Hollister homeboys. In fact, many &ldquo;seasonaires&rdquo;&mdash;the word for people who work ski seaons up in the mountains&mdash;aren&rsquo;t like that at all. Many of those I know are laborers or lost their jobs in the recession.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144548/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-10-28-39.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 420px;" /></p>
<p>
	Ski resorts are often sanctuaries for misfits, mid-life crisis sufferers, and the odd dodgy guy with a big scar down his neck who, you suspect, probably <em>can&rsquo;t</em> go home rather than won&rsquo;t go home. Every one of them, just like me, is either running from something or towards something else. They move to the mountains because they&rsquo;d rather live an existence that revolves around adrenaline and fresh morning powder than PS3 marathons and the kind of anonymous powders you buy off 30-year-old losers in parking lots.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it&rsquo;s true that there are also plenty of gap-year vagrants who make ski seasons feel like a succession of back-to-back freshman orientation weeks&mdash;overexcited, rudderless 19-year-olds rolling out of school and rocking up in the Alps without a clue what they&rsquo;re going to be doing for the next six months. Unable to clearly differentiate an ass from an elbow&mdash;let alone do an effective job of catering for holidaymakers&mdash;they spend the majority of their time doing stuff like drinking each other&rsquo;s piss or jumping off roofs into snow drifts after 30 shots of J&auml;germeister.</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, events involving this sort of seasonaire start to take on a sinister edge. One girl I worked with got herself into a very nasty fix after she was filmed blowing a trio of guys (all in costumes) after the Christmas party. I know this because the video was broadcast by one of the perpetrators on a TV in a bar later that week. Of course, it was consensual and she only had herself to blame, but I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that it looked a bit like borderline gang rape. And who exactly, I wondered, was supposed to be looking out for her?</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144392/189755-674364607790-2196623-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	Stories like this fit the grand tradition of seasonaire life. For instance, there was another girl a few years before our Christmas party, Belladonna, whom staff had nicknamed &ldquo;Harriet the Chariot.&rdquo; She was a talented swimmer who&rsquo;d once been groomed for Olympic duty, but had managed to escape her pushy mother and went off to work a season in a bar. By the end of her time there, she had slept with a total of 200 people, which&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve got my math right&mdash;means she must have been having sex with roughly two different guys a day.</p>
<p>
	My own foray into the alpine abyss was triggered by a particularly hostile breakup, involving an engagement ring, a defaulted mortgage, and a gracious sprinkling of bankruptcy. I&rsquo;d also only just got over the untimely death of my mother, who dropped dead suddenly from a heart attack when I was 21, and then my best friend bit it from a drug overdose.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s fair to say that I didn&rsquo;t exactly touch down for my first season in the most self-possessed state of mind.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144393/162929-584235632182-5428689-n.jpg" style="width: 476px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	Conveniently enough, though, it turned out that a ski resort is the ideal location to get over all these issues&mdash;mostly by getting fucked in every sense of the word. For a while, I went on a one-woman rampage, spending most of my days either up to my armpits in soap-suds and other people&rsquo;s pubic hair, having sex with stoned, broke teenagers on Tabasco-soaked mattresses, or careening down a mountain, fucked up on tranquilizers I&rsquo;d pinched from one of my chalet guest&rsquo;s bathroom cabinets.</p>
<p>
	This quickly descended into an amoral frenzy of bad behavior, which featured me cleaning toilets with my chalet guests&rsquo; toothbrushes, putting poop in their food as revenge for their rudeness, sinking vodka shots for breakfast, or doing a bunch of coke and driving seven-hour airport transfers.</p>
<p>
	In fact, more alarming episodes probably happened to me and those around me in that one season than throughout the rest of my life. I got buried up to my tits in snow after a roof slide, got pissed on by a paralytic French ski instructor, and nailed his friend off-piste in full view of a busy chair lift.</p>
<p>
	I gave numerous blow jobs in toilets and, on one occasion, woke up caked in my own vomit, naked in bed with a man I barely knew, and found a large piece of pink chewing gum stuck between my ass cheeks. Then there was the time I had a threesome in a $15,000-a-week chalet, reamed over an ottoman in nothing but ski boots and a beanie.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144388/487587-10151423825219539-1785085137-n-620x465.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	I should probably tell you about our guests. For a start, there was the vodka-saturated Ukrainian who let himself into the wrong chalet at four in the morning and got into bed with my guests&rsquo; eight-year-old son. This did not go down well&mdash;there was a lot of gnashing of teeth and screaming about pedophiles. Then there was the bachelor party&mdash;a bunch of guys who turned up with one of their &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; in tow, before offering their host, a wide-eyed 18-year-old girl from Devon, a line out of their huge bag of blow.</p>
<p>
	And, of course, there were the Latvian guests who turned up to my friend&rsquo;s chalet with a couple of six-foot-tall, leather-clad prostitutes, looking like something out of a mid-90s pay-per-view. They had soon littered the entire building with condoms, leaving blood stains and cocaine all over the leather sofas and fucking in the sauna in full view of my friend. But he wasn&rsquo;t complaining, particularly after they started having breakfast topless, or when he was gruffly offered one of the girls as an end-of-week tip.</p>
<p>
	So take from that what you will. But if you&rsquo;re looking for chronic thrush and the opportunity to rub your genitals against an assortment of unwashed people in weird locations (bubble lifts, parked cars in busy town centers, store cupboards, bar toilets, overpopulated bunk rooms), or hoping to break various appendages in the pursuit of enjoying yourself, a ski season is 100-percent the best way to do so.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144390/Oscar.jpg" style="width: 318px; height: 382px;" /></p>
<p>
	I have, of course, somewhat trounced my own point here. Instead of all this crassness, I could have talked about how ski seasons saved me from certain depression. That processing all my woes against a backdrop of soaring, inhospitable terrain taught me a lot about the minuteness of my problems and the corresponding insignificance of humanity as whole. Or that it introduced me to some of the most honest, motivated, and talented people I&#39;ve ever met.</p>
<p>
	But people don&rsquo;t want to hear about that. So I guess it&rsquo;s just much easier to accept the hackneyed, clich&eacute;d image of snowboarding and skiing as a club exclusively for twats&mdash;the preserve of bearded rich kids who say &ldquo;gnarly&rdquo; and &quot;far out&quot; a lot, and have trust funds and yacht club memberships.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144391/253985-10151332393565782-2055191344-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	Snow sports are adored by those who do, and dismissed by those who don&rsquo;t. Because the problem with skiing and snowboarding is that it&rsquo;s hard. You can&rsquo;t pay to be good at it; you have to earn it. Which actually makes it a great leveler. Believe me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve watched plenty of petulant, knock-kneed super-wives fail at the parallel turn to know it to be true. Thousands of bucks in private ski tuition and a shiny Moncler ski jacket do not a skier make.</p>
<p>
	So, as an ode to the experience, I wrote a book about it all. And some of the sex, drugs, and vomit stuff made it in there, too. But much to my disgust, it seems that at this point the publishing industry would much rather scope around for the next slab of saccharine chick-lit to sell to virgins than consider what I have to offer. They don&rsquo;t want vomit and VD&mdash;they want <em>P.S. I Love You</em> set in a snowstorm.</p>
<p>
	But my book has a bit about skiing on ketamine, for fuck&rsquo;s sake. What else should adolescent girls be reading about?</p>

<title>Milf Teeth: For Once, We Shouldn&#039;t Laugh at Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/stop-laughing-at-gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144709/GwynethPaltrowChrisMartinBreakup.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 444px;" /></p>
<p>
	Within minutes of its hitting the internet, the jokes started coming. Had Chris finally found out that Gwyneth wasn&rsquo;t actually British? Had she finally listened to a Coldplay album? Who would get custody of Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z? Then, when it became apparent that Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin had <a href="http://www.goop.com/journal/be/conscious-uncoupling" target="_blank">announced their marriage break-up</a> as a feature on her lifestyle website Goop, describing the process as a &quot;conscious uncoupling,&quot; the real trolling began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Of course it did. This is an actress who also used Goop to advertise for a private tutor who would work weekends to teach her kids ancient Greek, Japanese, philosophy, tennis, sailing, and chess&mdash;lessons they were being heinously deprived of at their private school. The children were five and seven years old at the time. The husband is the frontman of a band who sells millions of emotionally tweaking records and who was personally <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/39666/chris_martin_responds_to_bonos_wanker_comment/" target="_blank">described as a &quot;wanker</a>&quot; on live radio. By Bono. Imagine being described as a wanker by Bono. I do not believe I am exaggerating when I say it would be like your dog standing up on its hind legs in your kitchen one day and suddenly laughing at you for being a dog.</p>
<p>
	So not only does &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; sound pretty funny, especially if you&rsquo;re more familiar with the unconscious kind, when you go out and get so drunk that you can&rsquo;t even remember getting dumped, but Gwyneth had added a 2,000-word essay from two of her gurus on the spiritual aspects of a healthy break-up. People don&rsquo;t usually try to rebrand the entire concept of divorce while announcing that they&rsquo;re having one, but then Gwyneth is, as my friend Bim put it, a total gangster. The thing about everything these gurus say about conscious uncoupling, though, is that it is true.</p>
<p>
	OK, so this Goop essay contains some unanticipated real talk about insects and their exoskeletons versus the endoskeletons of us vertebrates (and how there was a time, millions of years ago, when a dragonfly&rsquo;s wing measured three feet across, leading to a Russian theory about the creation of insects being a failed attempt by nature to evolve a higher form of consciousness). But more important than the arthropodology is the sense that these are two very famous people who had two very human children and are trying very hard to find a way to still be a family, to let the crack down the middle of them feel like more of a seam.</p>
<p>
	The idea of failed marriage, as theirs will now be described, is so old and rotten that I think I prefer these brave new words of &quot;conscious uncoupling.&quot; What&rsquo;s a failure about more than ten years and two new human beings, raised in love? We&#39;ve got to get over this idea that only &quot;forever&quot; counts. People used to die at 47, and now that&#39;s when they remarry. The life cycle has changed, as Gwyneth&#39;s cheery newsletter points out.</p>
<p>
	People don&rsquo;t fail&mdash;machines fail. Marriage is not a machine; there is no success, there is no failure. Was Leonard and Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s marriage a failure? She preferred women, and they didn&rsquo;t have children, or sexual intercourse. One day she wrote him a note, filled her pockets with stones, and threw herself in the river. Yet the letters they wrote each other, over the years, are among the tenderest things I&rsquo;ve read. &ldquo;You have given me the greatest possible happiness. I don&#39;t think two people could have been happier than we have been,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/02/i-cant-fight-any-longer.html" target="_blank">she said to him</a>, and that&rsquo;s just in her suicide note.</p>
<p>
	Life is like a big bag of raw meat, by the end dripping with piss and blood, ill-defined pauses, and a cinema reel of moments lost and moments gained. I can see why people are laughing at Goop. Positive thinking is a truly helpful tool in so much of life, but sometimes, just sometimes, you want the perfect blond movie star to stand back and say, <em>This is the pits. My feelings are smashed across the floor like a broken bottle of cooking oil</em>. <em>The future is gray. My brain aches. I&rsquo;m through.</em></p>
<p>
	And yet, personally speaking, conscious uncoupling sounds a hell of a lot better than what I&rsquo;ve managed in my own life. Falling out with the person with whom you created children is a heartbreak that I can&rsquo;t even describe. You can&rsquo;t drink it away or find someone else so that it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. It will <em>always</em> matter. It&rsquo;s a feeling you wouldn&rsquo;t wish on your worst enemy, although you don&rsquo;t even have to, because the person you loved has already slipped into that role. Your very own angry ghost.</p>
<p>
	So if those cheery blond quinoa-munching celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin can consciously uncouple, and teach the rest of us how to do it, then please go ahead. I for one will listen. The angry silences can burn a hole in your heart otherwise.</p>

<title>The Arab Spring Was Just a Translation Mistake</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/the-arab-spring-was-a-translation-mistake</link>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144482/Arab-Spring-map-svg.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 349px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 16px;">Image via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arab_Spring_map.svg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span> </em></p>
<p>
	From the all-out civil war in Syria to the internet restrictions in Turkey and the return of military rule in Egypt, the revolutionary youth of the Arab Spring seem to be facing one hurdle after another. VICE obtained an exclusive copy of a study that concluded that the &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; seems to have been just a &ldquo;translation mistake.&rdquo; Additionally, there is no evidence at all to support the theory that people in the Middle East had revolted against their rulers. The revelations come as an embarrassment to Western media outlets that have been claiming for three years that people from Tunisia to Syria were engaged in popular uprisings, as it becomes apparent that the misperception was a result of a multitude of translation mistakes by reporters and commentators who are not sufficiently versed in Arabic.</p>
<p>
	The study that VICE obtained a copy of prior to publication was conducted by a panel of European and American experts and was funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, but there is nothing to suggest that it had ulterior motives in commissioning the report beyond its commitment to truth and accuracy in reporting. The experts analyzed hundreds of videos and articles and recorded many witness testimonies that all firmly point to a giant misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
	According to the report, Western reporters in Tunisia and Egypt were confused by the scenes of thousands of people on the streets and wrongly assumed that they were protesting against the regimes when in fact they were spontaneously expressing their support for their leaders. Upon reading the reports in the Western press, Tunisia&rsquo;s former president, Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, a sensitive and considerate leader much beloved by his people, felt deeply hurt and decided to leave power before the truth emerged.</p>
<p>
	A similar scenario was repeated in Egypt, when President Hosni Mubarak decided to leave power rather than risk upsetting his people. The report points out to Western support of the two presidents as evidence of their essential goodness, as it is inconceivable that the Western powers would support corrupt dictatorial regimes.</p>
<p>
	A crucial piece of evidence was the mistranslation of the phrase <em>al sha&rsquo;ab yurid ithbat al nizam</em> (the people want the stability of the regime) as <em>al sha&rsquo;ab yurid isqat al nizam</em> (the people want the fall of the regime). The reporters quizzed about this claimed that it was very loud during these demonstrations, and it was an honest mistake than anyone could make.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, events quickly spiraled out of control before anyone could correct these mistakes, and as the celebrations spread to other Arab countries, the Western press continued to misinterpret them as protests against the rulers. The study harshly criticized lack of familiarity with Arab culture and norms and poor language skills for these failings, which have inadvertently destabilized the region and perhaps the entire world for years to come.</p>
<p>
	A spokesman for the Saudi government outlined the reasons for commissioning the study arguing that the Kingdom has always been interested in promoting cultural understanding and accuracy of reporting, so it decided to use its resources to correct this giant mistake. &ldquo;Arab people have huge respect for their leaders, and protests have no place in our culture. Sadly, foreign reporters misinterpreted these events due to their lack of training in cultural sensitivity and poor grasp of the complex Arab language,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Tragically it seems that the very first public gathering that sparked the theory of an &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; was a surprise birthday party that people in one Tunisian town had planned for their leader and that Western journalists present misinterpreted as a demonstration. The passionate and raucous nature of Arab celebrations was lost on the reporters, who are predisposed to see Arabs as angry mobs. The report recommends further investment by Western governments and media outlets in cultural sensitivity training to overcome those barriers in the future.</p>
<p>
	The Saudi spokesman urged everyone involved to come together to put a line underneath this chapter, citing his government&rsquo;s effort to end the misunderstanding in Egypt and repair the damage done by misguided Western reporting. &ldquo;We are very close to re-establishing the situation exactly as it was in 2010 before all of this started. Please urge your governments to support us in correcting this historical error.&rdquo; He lamented how a small translation mistake caused this much damage, and urged Western reporters to rely on official version of events in the future to avoid such confusion.</p>

<title>I Dumpster-Dived with a Bunch of Freegans</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/i-dumpster-dove-with-a-bunch-of-freegans</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 16:23:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144418/dumpster-diving.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Look at that haul. All photos by the author</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	So there I was, groping around in a pile of trash in the middle of the night. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	People stared at the spectacle of a dozen dumpster divers carrying recyclable Trader Joe&rsquo;s bags through NYC&rsquo;s Upper East Side neighborhood. They didn&rsquo;t look like they needed handouts, but they were digging through the trash in the streets not too far from Park Avenue. They were calling it &ldquo;a movement.&rdquo; These people are freegans: a group dedicated to saving food, shampoo, furniture, and anything else that people waste. They want to fight the system of consumerism because they believe it squanders the stuff people need. No one was homeless. On any given night, this meetup group hooks bagel stalkers from different age brackets and socioeconomic backgrounds with their e-mail newsletter. I saw a college kid break bread with a veteran. Each diver has different standards and different favorite foods, but they all share a bootstrapper&rsquo;s mentality and are almost always on the hunt for things that are free. The food was for us, friends, people on the street&mdash;anything to keep it from piling up in a landfill. When someone throws something away, legally it&#39;s a public item, but that doesn&#39;t keep police and restaurant owners from hassling them.</p>
<p class="p1">
	There were people who survived solely on what they found, and people who dived twice a month who were just in it for the free food. And there was a lot of it.</p>
<p class="p1">
	The inventory from the biggest haul came from Gristedes grocery story: bottles of kombucha, stacks of pre-packaged guacamole and hummus, watermelons, peppers, breads, celery, salads, and packages of tri-colored fettuccine. It&rsquo;s like this outside most grocery stores every night, but Saturdays are when the masses clean most stores out. There was plenty to go around for everyone&rsquo;s personal stash and for the group feast that would happen tomorrow night. The leader gave me the address on a slip of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144422/dumpster-dive-haul.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>The haul from Gristedes</i></p>
<p class="p3">
	I&rsquo;d been curious about freeganism for years. I wanted to know what a dive was like, what freegans considered cool to salvage and how hardcore it was. It shocked me that I wasn&rsquo;t grossed out. But jacking $50 worth of pristine quinoa salads tossed into the garbage required so little effort. There wasn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; in the bag. I was relieved that there were no discarded napkins or coffee filters to scrounge through; it was just a bag of salads and wraps in their packaging that had expired that day. &ldquo;Companies are conservative with their expiration dates,&rdquo; Janet, our leader, explained.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I looked over to a mild-mannered Wes Anderson doppelg&auml;nger who worked as an intern at a Chelsea gallery as he pointed a flashlight to reveal packages of Japanese sweet potatoes. A woman offered me a container of cold gazpacho she pulled just because I said I loved it, but I told her to keep it. A Brooklyn freegan once told me that people can get cagey about their prime spots, but most freegans believe in sharing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I scooped out a filmy $12 bag of shiitake mushrooms from Dean &amp; Deluca for the feast the next night. There were no takers for the bag of loose pieces of Swiss cheese because a regular diver, Adam, wasn&rsquo;t there. Adam&rsquo;s known for dunking his hand into unwrapped food and eats right out of the garbage.</p>
<p class="p1">
	As people walked by, they took interest in the operation going on. Some passerby swiped a still-soft chocolate chip cookie from the huge pile without stopping. A man slipped into the crowd trying to hide his grocery bags from Gristedes. &ldquo;This proves it&rsquo;s a bad economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all suffering, right?&rdquo; Then he walked off; he must have decided earlier that even though he was suffering, he preferred to pay for his guacamole.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144421/dumpster-dive-bag.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p3">
	A recently unemployed woman ate her salad wrap rescued from outside of Organic Avenue.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;re being resourceful,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;Yeah. It helps,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;Would you go alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel too weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	I had to consider if I would. I imagined myself all alone, checking out the trash in broad daylight, looking not exactly pathetic but whatever is one level less nuts than that. I decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I was still marveling at how inviting and brightly colorful it all looked on the curb when it was time to tie up the rejects&mdash;bananas browned from days of neglect&mdash;and move on. Dumpster divers leave garbage sites nicer than they were before. They have that in common with Girl Scouts.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Being an amateur myself, I picked up some slimy garbage in hopes of finding something edible, and accidentally discarded it in a fellow diver&rsquo;s general direction. A yellow rubber glove appeared in front of my face.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wore these,&rdquo; a fellow diver named Mohammed said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144426/dumpster-dive.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Look how much fun we&#39;re having!</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	The Italian market Agata &amp; Valentina, the most upscale target on our hit list, was a bust. It was closed, but lust-worthy aromas of the prepared foods inside reached every corner of my nose. Outside, I lifted a bag of severed pineapple tops to find a ton of raw meat. Too scrappy. Too much work for the group.</p>
<p class="p1">
	We moved on, passing V-Note, a vegan restaurant. It would have been awkward to hit them up, what with everyone enjoying dinner and all. &ldquo;We could claw at the window and go through their trash while they ate,&rdquo; Cindy, the sarcastic leader said, laughing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Dragging my free broccoli home, I had sticky ice cream hands thanks to some suspicious goo that collects on salad in a bag. It&rsquo;s cool. I scrubbed my hands six times like I was reenacting Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s OCD post-murder hand washing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	The next night was the feast, located in a residential building in East Harlem. They hold them to reward people who find food and share it. I set about chopping garlic, onions, and celery in the communal kitchen. My first task was simple enough: get rid of the mealy bits on the tomato with a cleaver. People come if they&rsquo;ve been on the dive the night before, or they find something to bring in on their own. One woman produced potatoes and had prolonged their life span by separating them in her worn-to-death stockings.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144429/dumpster-dive-meal.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p1">
	Our rosemary bread was rock-hard, but it was nothing a microwave couldn&rsquo;t fix. &ldquo;I promise no one will get sick on this,&rdquo; a cheery leader said. A drunk guy stumbled in looking for chitlins. Almost everyone was vegan&mdash;mostly for &nbsp;moral reasons&mdash;so he gave up, but not before delivering a lecture on how an onion can heal a broken leg if you can&rsquo;t afford to go the hospital.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Every age bracket was represented at the dive, but at the feast, it was mostly people who were retired&mdash;an improv teacher, a former management consultant&mdash;and the lone young unemployed legal assistant. Not every diver survives on a strict freegan diet; some of them donate food they find to <a href="http://www.foodnotbombs.net/"><span class="s2">Food Not Bombs</span></a>, a collective that feeds people in need with rescued food in order to create a more sustainable future. One guy talked about the young kids who jump out of a van to take all the trash from Organic Avenue on 21<span class="s3"><sup>st</sup></span> Street. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so ragged they look like they live in the subway,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I stared at my dish, which would elate hungry people everywhere, feeling disappointed in myself. I worried about anorexia rumors.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Somehow, bagging up the &ldquo;rescued food&rdquo; seemed less dicey than the end result: eating it. Boxed spelt crackers and cranberry oatmeal cookies tasted the safest. The stir-fry smelled good enough, but those $12 mushrooms and the tofu were gray. However, I&rsquo;d pay full price for the asparagus, and the rice and beans were restaurant-quality.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144430/dumpster-dive-meal-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p1">
	These people were passionate and intelligent, but most of this stuff just wasn&rsquo;t appetizing. It still impressed me that all this food would go to waste if it weren&#39;t for them.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I went into this thinking <i>garbage... never good</i>. But it struck me: the stuff was fresh enough to eat, and I didn&rsquo;t poison myself. In the end, my own hangups about where it came from tugged at my stomach and got in the way of rational thinking. This was something I personally applauded, but didn&rsquo;t want to take up.</p>
<p class="p1">
	So I chewed, nodding to signal how impressed I was while I fantasized about tunneling myself into the nearest steakhouse for a rehabilitative lamb chop. I was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t into it; all the others finished their plates. As I washed the dishes, they invited me to dive again. But while they&rsquo;re onto something, I remain a slave to the system. I prefer to see my food on a clean shelf.</p>

<title>Social Media Isn&#039;t a Threat to the Turkish Government</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/erdogan-twitter-ban-leaks</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:12:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144376/image.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 446px;" /></p>

	<em>Turkish Prime Minister&nbsp;Recep Tayyip Erdogan on TV. Photo by Ekin &Ouml;zbi&ccedil;er</em></p>
<p>
	It was 11P M on a Thursday night in Yenik&ouml;y, a neighborhood in the northern part of Istanbul. My wife and I sat in our living room, watching Turkey&#39;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, address his followers at a pre-election rally in the city of Bursa. The rant was about Twitter. &ldquo;Twitter, shwitter!&rdquo; he yelled at an ecstatic crowd. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to uproot it! I don&rsquo;t care what the international community says. We&rsquo;re dealing with an international conspiracy here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I switched the channel, and there it was again: Erdogan&#39;s face, contorted and angry. Another channel, the same face&mdash;neatly trimmed, Islam-approved mustache bobbing up and down as he continued to shout about the evils of social media, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2J1V420140320" target="_blank">threatening</a> to shut down Twitter and other social networking sites.</p>
<p>
	This scapegoating wasn&#39;t anything particularly new, either; it&#39;s just that the target had changed. Previously, he&#39;s blamed an elusive <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577154353478071244" target="_blank">&ldquo;interest rate lobby,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/islamist-turkey-pm-threatens-to-expel-us-ambassador-for-corruption-comments/" target="_blank">the US</a>,<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/12/pro-erdogan-media-says-israel-behind-corruption-probe.html#" target="_blank">Israel</a>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&quot;<a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-erdogan-calls-protesters-atheists-leftists-terrorists.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=63068&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">the atheists</a>,&quot; and even <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/columnists/gunay-hilal-aygun_339852-what-if-an-uncovered-woman-claimed-she-had-been-attacked.html" target="_blank">topless men dressed in leather</a> for the violence and economic losses that came out of the massive Gezi protests last summer. Now Twitter is the guilty party. &ldquo;Twitter and all [the other social media outlets]&mdash;none of them are bigger than our nation,&quot; he proclaimed. The following day, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/03/turks-report-widespread-twitter-outages-20143210429682465.html" target="_blank">authorities blocked access to Twitter</a>&mdash;a move that was denounced by President&nbsp;Abdullah G&uuml;l.</p>
<p>
	Given that a leaked wiretap revealing the illicit goings-on of his government has been released in segments on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm" target="_blank">every day</a> for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/twitter-blocked-in-turkey-amid-sons-of-thieves-leaks.html">the past month</a>, Erdogan&rsquo;s beef with the micro-messaging site isn&#39;t exactly surprising. The government is attributing these leaks to a mysterious&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/24/us-turkey-investigation-idUSBREA1N1EO20140224" target="_blank">&ldquo;parallel state&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;(a former suspect was the <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-accuses-robot-lobby-of-conducting-plot-against-the-govt.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=62928&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">&quot;robot lobby&quot;</a>), <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116044/fethullah-gulen-turkish-prime-minister-erdogans-biggest-rival" target="_blank">implying that the secretive Fethullah G&uuml;len</a>&mdash;a past ally of Erdogan&#39;s, but now a rival Islamist leader living in exile in Pennsylvania&mdash;is responsible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The leaks started surfacing right after&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0607420140107" target="_blank">some 1,700 police officers</a>&nbsp;were reassigned and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/22/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0L1G220140122" target="_blank">roughly 120</a> judges and prosecutors were implicated in the &quot;<a href="http://www.thenewturkey.org/what-have-we-learned-from-the-december-17-operation/new-turkey/8619" target="_blank">December 17 Operation</a>&quot;&mdash;a criminal investigation into government corruption. A number of high profile personalities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25475859" target="_blank">(including the sons</a> of some of Erdogan&rsquo;s closest associates) have already been arrested on&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turkey" target="_blank">charges</a> of embezzlement, bribery, smuggling, and international money laundering. Inquiries are ongoing.</p>
<p>
	The source of the leaks are two suggestively named Twitter accounts&mdash;Haramzadeler (&ldquo;Sons of sinners&rdquo;) and Baş &Ccedil;alan (&ldquo;Prime Thief&rdquo;)&mdash;which have outed Erdogan and his closest stooges&rsquo; private conversations. The (unproven) <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/erdogan-calls-judiciary-tape.html#" target="_blank">leaks</a> have implied that there are no limits to the prime minister&rsquo;s reach, suggesting he single-handedly micro-managed the fate of controversial real estate development projects and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkKSJxu5NHM " target="_blank">handpicked university deans</a> (a role reserved for the president),<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/world/europe/turkey-corruption-inquiry.html" target="_blank">supreme court judges</a> (a role reserved for the High Commission of Judges and Prosecutors, a supposedly independent body), and even popular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pSZJJI0wVM" target="_blank">football</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3olqIqOt9E" target="_blank">chairmen</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
	The public believed it to be a case of self-censorship when privately owned national news channels decided to broadcast cooking shows and <a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/zeynep-tufekci/pepper-spray-and-penguins-analysis-turkeys-social-media-fueled-gezi-protests" target="_blank">documentaries about penguins</a> during the massive Gezi protests, but it appears that nearly all of those decisions had been down to Erdogan. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ah8DjSXDTE" target="_blank">He reportedly watched every single TV show</a>&mdash;even following the news tickers along the bottom of the screen&mdash;and read every piece of news he could.</p>
<p>
	He allegedly instructed his allies on the editorial boards to interfere with the content he disliked, pulled newscasters off the air, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46IPrTw9RKI " target="_blank">fired voices</a> too critical for his taste. The illicit&mdash;and yet to be verified&mdash;leaks give the impression of a media system where all the main players, thanks to their interest in maintaining government contracts, had been not only complying but actively cooperating with the government and its demands.</p>

	Back to that ordinary Thursday night. A few hours after Erdogan&rsquo;s rant about Twitter, we switched the channel to CNN T&uuml;rk. On screen was the journalist Abdulkadir Selvi, a known government apologist, who was commenting on the speech we&#39;d just watched:</p>
<blockquote>
	[Forces] are trying to redesign Turkey through publishing illegal recordings on this internet [<em>sic</em>]. Unlike how it would play out in the US, UK, or France, the court orders are not fulfilled by Twitter or Facebook. If someone listened to President Obama&rsquo;s private calls illegally and leaked them on Twitter, we know they would be promptly packed away to Guant&aacute;namo. When it comes to Turkey, though, nobody cares about court orders or protection of the private lives of its citizens. They have to come open their offices here and respect the Turkish law&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the PM meant. Otherwise he neither has [the] will nor the power to shut Twitter down, and I would be the first to oppose if he did.</blockquote>
<p>
	It seemed that Selvi was totally oblivious to the events that followed the rise of WikiLeaks and its massive campaign against America&#39;s military and government, in that all <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/01/07/report-us-subpoenas.html" target="_blank">the subpoenas</a>, take-down notices, and identity requests they sent to Twitter admins achieved absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In fact, Erdogan and his co-conspirators are much luckier than their Western counterparts in many ways. As the leaks show, their focus has been largely local or, at most, regional&mdash;an illegal shipment of gold to Iran here, a bribe from Dubai there, a little power mongering and corruption on the side. This stuff is nowhere near as controversial as Edward Snowden&rsquo;s NSA/GCHQ/PRISM leaks, which exposed outrageous misconduct on a global scale.</p>
<p>
	And what happened there? Well, Snowden won&#39;t be going back to Virginia any time soon, but he isn&#39;t exactly locked up in Guant&aacute;namo, either. And despite all the uproar, it seems that operations at the British and American intelligence agencies are continuing as normal.</p>
<p>
	Erdogan and his allies need to understand what their Western counterparts have already grasped&mdash;that without citizens being able to vent through social media, you run the risk of them taking their frustrations to the street. And as the governments of Turkey&rsquo;s surrounding countries saw during the Arab Spring, Molotov cocktails and braying mobs are much better at toppling rulers than angry tweets and Facebook updates.</p>
<p>
	Instead of turning to violence, we spend every day waiting for the next leak, like our parents spent every week waiting for a new episode of <em>Dallas</em>. And like J. R. Ewing, Erdogan has become a baddy of light entertainment&mdash;someone we love to hate, just another player in a society obsessed with spectacle. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s why all the leaks in the world ultimately won&#39;t make any difference to Erdogan or his government. Accepting the social media response to a government scandal has the power to prevent legitimate physical action&mdash;it turns the outrage into another storyline within the grand spectacle, morphing Erdogan from a tyrant into a TV villain. Which is exactly why he needs to drop his assault on Twitter, because, in the end, people will naturally lose interest in the drama. Just like Berlusconi, Bush, and Sarkozy, the ratings will drop, and Erdogan will fade away into obscurity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Yemeni Plaster Workers Are Getting High on Khat</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/yemeni-plaster-workers-are-getting-high-on-khat</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 12:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144213/sanaa-skyline.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 390px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">The World Heritage Site sprawls out beneath the sundeck of the Old City&rsquo;s tallest building.</span></em></p>
<p>
	Troubled by its country&rsquo;s notorious reputation for civil unrest and terrorism, Yemen&rsquo;s capital, Sanaa, has been fighting a losing battle to preserve its architectural history. With over 6,500 inhabited buildings more than three times the age of the United States, Sanaa&rsquo;s Old City district is among UNESCO&rsquo;s most remarkable <a href="http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/sanaa.html">World Heritage Sites</a>. This labyrinth of mud-brick markets, gardens, and homes is elaborately adorned with distinctive, white-plaster designs that wrap and decorate its exterior. However, while tourism has plummeted in recent years, the job of maintaining Sanaa&rsquo;s heritage continues in the same surprisingly perilous manner as it has since the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>
	Each year Arabian dust storms erode the Old City&rsquo;s plasterwork, and painters go to work restoring its artistic charm. Across the skyline painters descend from the rooftops, balancing themselves on narrow wooden platforms that are suspended only by a single rope. Unlike modern window washers, the painters&rsquo; work is characterized by centuries of tradition. That means laboring without harnesses or safety equipment on buildings reaching ten stories high.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144214/sanaa-building-collapse.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 426px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>A building that recently collapsed because of leaky plumbing and poor maintenance</em></span></p>
<p>
	Their pulley system, which is powered sustainably by manual labor, can have its drawbacks. And so painters often find themselves hanging halfway down a building&rsquo;s exterior when the time comes for Islamic prayer. Because of the team&rsquo;s limited lifting abilities, the painters can only be lowered downward, not hoisted up. This leaves the painters with only one way of getting back to the top: Relying solely on their sheer strength, they climb the rope hand over hand, walking up the side of the building.</p>
<p>
	And the whole time, they&rsquo;re high on khat&mdash;a slightly euphoric leafy green plant that is ingested like chewing tobacco. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re painting you have to be strong, and when I chew I can do the work perfectly,&rdquo; said Mohammed al Seeani. At the age of 65, Mohammed has 40 years of painting under his belt, making him one of the most experienced and respected painters in Yemen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I used to carry water from the well when I was young, and I noticed a painting crew mixing water and gypsum nearby,&rdquo; Mohammed remembered. Curious about their work, he approached the men who began to teach him about their craft. &ldquo;Then one day there was a well that was very deep, 65 meters (about 200 feet). It had been clogged by dirt, and they needed to remove it in order to get the water underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144215/sanaa-plaster-worker-pullie.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 966px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Mohammed making his way from the stable rooftop to his wobbly platform</span></em></p>
<p>
	Rappelling into these dim and claustrophobic well shafts is a right of passage for aspiring painters and considered a test of a candidate&rsquo;s mental readiness. &ldquo;They took the rope, and if it&#39;s your first time, they put it around your stomach,&rdquo; Mohammed said. He had once known a man that was well diving when the rope snapped, plunging the man into the darkness below. Fortunately, Mohammed resurfaced unscathed and self-assured. &ldquo;After the well incident I knew I wanted to paint the houses,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Nowadays the painters&rsquo; work has become increasingly hazardous due to the rapid deterioration of the Old City&rsquo;s buildings. In fact, more than 400 homes throughout the Heritage Site have collapsed due to <a href="http://www.yementimes.com/en/1652/news/2020/Building-violations-on-the-rise-in-the-Old-City.htm">new construction and the installation</a> of water piping in these 11th century dwellings. Over the years, leaky plumbing has gradually eroded the buildings from the inside out while poor drainage has softened the roofs the painters work on. &ldquo;One time in my work, there were three ceiling beams that fell from above and hit my son, but he was OK and was working a month and a half later,&rdquo; Mohammed recalled.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144218/sanaa-belay-khat.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">A Yemeni teen is charged with the responsibility of belaying the rope that supports both Mohammed and his platform.</span></em></p>
<p>
	The neglected state of the Old City prompted UNESCO to consider revoking Sanaa&rsquo;s World Heritage Site status last spring. According to Mohammed, financial support from UNESCO spurred the government to call up painters from around the country in an effort to maintain its UN designation. A mobilization of this scale had only happened once previously in 2004, when the government (again with UNESCO funding) employed 140 painters to repaint all of the Old City.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;All of us painters are friends,&rdquo; said Mohammed. &ldquo;When the government rehires them all, all of them will come. Just one phone call, and all of them will be in Sanaa.&rdquo; Until then, Mohammed continues to train his teenage son, passing the age-old techniques on to the next generation.</p>

<title>VICE News: The Devil Tried to Divide Us - Part 5</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	The Central African Republic&#39;s capital of Bangui has seen its Muslim population drop from 130,000 to under 1,000 during the past few months. Over the past year, thousands across CAR have been killed, and nearly a million have been displaced. The United Nations recently stated that the entire Western half of the country has now been cleansed of Muslims.<br />
	<br />
	CAR has never fully recovered from France&#39;s colonial rule, and it has only known ten years of a civilian government&mdash;from 1993 to 2003&mdash;since achieving independence in 1960. Coup after coup, often with French military involvement, has led many to refer to the country as a phantom state. The current conflict has now completely erased the rule of law, leaving the UN and international community looking confused and impotent.<br />
	<br />
	In March 2013, the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, a mostly Muslim rebel alliance, rose up and overthrew the corrupt government of Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, while bringing terror and chaos across the country&mdash;pillaging, killing, and raping with impunity. In response, mostly Christian self-defense forces, called the Anti-Balaka, formed to defend CAR against S&eacute;l&eacute;ka attacks.<br />
	<br />
	Clashes grew more frequent throughout 2013 as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka grew more ruthless. In December 2013, French and African troops went in to disarm the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka and staunch the bloodshed. The Anti-Balaka, seizing on a weakened S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, then went on the offensive.<br />
	<br />
	CAR had no real history of religious violence, and the current conflict is not based on any religious ideology. The fighting, however, turned increasingly sectarian in the fall of 2013, with revenge killings becoming the norm. And as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka&#39;s power waned, the Anti-Balaka fed their need for revenge by brutalizing Muslim civilians.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	&quot;Too few peacekeepers were deployed too late; the challenge of disarming the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, containing the Anti-Balaka, and protecting the Muslim minority was underestimated,&quot; Human Rights Watch said in a recent statement.<br />
	<br />
	The bloodshed has not stopped. The UN is still debating whether or not to send peacekeepers. Even if a peacekeeping operation is approved, it will take six months for troops to be assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Basurero Is Burning: Life at the Gates of Hell in Guatemala City</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144284/Basurero-opener.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Guatemala City&#39;s massive dump as seen from above. All photos by author</i></p>
<p>
	In early January 2014, a fire broke out beneath the festering mountain of garbage that is Guatemala City&#39;s dump. The fire department half-heartedly tried to extinguish the inferno with water and suffocate it with bulldozers full of dirt, but it refused to go out, fueled by the chemical waste and toxic refuse deep below the surface of the trash pile. Seen from an airplane approaching the impoverished nation&#39;s airport, the acrid smoke billowing from the ugly gash in the center of the city looked like an open volcanic fault or the gates to hell.</p>
<p>
	Although the blaze on the surface of the trash heap was eventually extinguished and there are no open flames today, those who work in the dump say there are fires continuously burning deep within the trash pile, and while the firefighters continue to attempt to extinguish them, according to observers and residents they don&rsquo;t have the right equipment to completely extinguish the chemical-soaked piles. The fire technically only burned for two days in January, but I&#39;ve been told it smoldered within the garbage pile for a month before then.</p>
<p>
	Some 7,000 people work from dawn to dusk, 365 days a year in the dump&mdash;whole families spend their lives collecting plastic, metal, and old magazines from out of the trash heap to sell to recyclers. Around 1,000 of these <em>guajeros</em>, as the trash-pickers are called, are children, according to residents.</p>
<p>
	One elderly guajero told me he has worked in the <em>basurero </em>(Spanish for <em>dump</em>&mdash;it&rsquo;s also the name of the neighborhood where the guajeroslive) for 50 years, but in recent years there has been an influx of people coming here to join him. Many families have been driven to the basurero by poverty brought on by the global economic crisis coupled with mismanagement on the part of the Guatemalan government.</p>
<p>
	The work they do is incredibly dangerous, and the pay is terrible. At the end of the day, the guajeros go home across the street from the dump to a warren of garbage-choked alleyways and shacks made from corrugated metal and old tarpaulins. Because of the barrio&#39;s proximity to the dump, the air is always thick with the foul smoke of the garbage fires. Even at noon on an otherwise clear day, the sky over the basurero is white with thick smoke and dust.</p>
<p>
	There are no current estimates of the level of air contamination in the neighborhood, but a 2012 survey by the University of San Carlos found that the average annual amount of particulate contamination in the air at a testing station less than two miles from the dump was 94 micrograms per cubic meter of air. By comparison, the EPA recommends a <em>maximum</em> annual level of just 75 micrograms per cubic meter. In other parts of Guatemala City, air contamination averages around 45 micrograms per cubic meter, and even that seems dirty to most people from the US. Residents of the basurero complain of chronic congestion, constant headaches, and high rates of asthma and respiratory problems.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Our health is always worse,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute;, a local community leader, his eyes glassy and bloodshot. The only creatures that seem to thrive in the basurero are the thousands of vultures that constantly circle above the neighborhood.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>One of the alleyways where residents of the basurero live.</i></p>
<p>
	The danger to the guajeros and their families is not limited to dirty air. People die from accidents in the dump &ldquo;all the time,&rdquo; one worker told me. Many of the guajeros are addicted to crack or powder cocaine, and there&rsquo;s little in the way of formal authority. Portions of Zona 3, as the surrounding area is called, are reputedly under the de facto control of competing groups of narco traffickers, which can create a certain level of order and security, but the basurero itself is in a kind of no-man&#39;s land. &ldquo;The government controls nothing&rdquo; was how Jos&eacute; described it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We asked for medical help, it didn&#39;t happen. We asked for security, it didn&#39;t happen. We asked for ambulances, it didn&#39;t happen,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; told me. He said that although there&rsquo;s a clinic with doctors who visit regularly, there&rsquo;s never any medicine there, and added that the community&#39;s single greatest need is new roofs for their huts.</p>
<p>
	Many adults working in the basurero cannot read or write, including Jose, and most families are illegally squatting on the land they live on, but the grimmest thing about the current situation in the slum is that for many of the people who came to the neighborhood from the countryside, moving here was supposed to be a step up from their former lives.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Most of them have no school or very little school, maybe some elementary,&rdquo; said Andrea Marroqu&iacute;n, the head of PR for <a href="http://www.safepassage.org/" target="_blank">Camino Seguro</a> (&quot;Safe Passage&quot;), an NGO that works to provide education to children of guajeros. &ldquo;They&#39;re looking for new opportunities here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The last major migration to the basurero occurred in 2009, shortly after the world financial meltdown. The crash came at the beginning of a process of land consolidation by the sugar plantations, and many poor people who had previously been tenant farmers found their livelihoods swallowed up in land deals. Moreover, those from the south of Guatemala generally have fewer relatives living in the United States, and so received less money from family members working abroad compared to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>
	Direct investment in Guatemala dropped 20 percent between 2008 and 2009 (it recovered the following year), and the bottom fell out of the economy. At the same time, the price of basic commodities began to skyrocket&mdash;the cost of providing food for a family in Guatemala grew 50 percent from 2007 to 2011. The construction jobs that many poor people had relied on disappeared, and remittances sent to Guatemalans from friends and relatives abroad plunged 10 percent from 2008 to 2009. Guatemala&#39;s rate of GPD growth dropped from 6.3 percent in 2007 to a low of just 0.5 percent in 2009. By then, the entire world was suffering the effects of a recession, and poor Guatemalans were hit especially hard.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;In 2009 and 2010, the economy was very slow, and these people probably rely on day-to-day labor,&rdquo; said Araceli Martinez, an anthropologist at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. &ldquo;What they have left is the city, and where in the city? The slums.&rdquo; Once they arrived in the basurero, recent migrants found themselves without skills and community networks they had previously relied upon to get work. Migrants tended to cluster together with others from the same town or region, further reducing their ability to access labor markets in Guatemala City. As a result, the only work they can find is picking through the dump&rsquo;s immense mounds of garbage.</p>
<p>
	For those who have moved to the basurero, the work is a way &ldquo;to live the day,&rdquo; Andrea said. &ldquo;It&#39;s all about perspective. They don&#39;t see the health problems, and for them [trash picking is] an income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Yet once people arrive in the basurero, they rarely find a better life. Lacking an education and never earning enough money to save a nest egg, families get stuck in the slums, where they don&rsquo;t have access to the city&rsquo;s social services.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Even if you move from a beautiful, clean town in the country&hellip; the perception is that moving to the city, even to a slum, is moving up,&rdquo; Araceli said. &ldquo;But it&#39;s only an illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It falls to private charitable organizations to provide basic services in the neighborhood. Camino Seguro tries to help by providing education to children and food to families in addition to adult tutoring, but it doesn&rsquo;t have nearly enough resources. &ldquo;After they finish school they come here&hellip; we try to keep them in a safe space,&rdquo; Andrea said. The children receive tutoring, regular checkups, and meals. &ldquo;None of our kids have malnutrition,&rdquo; Andrea told me, &ldquo;and that&#39;s a success for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144287/Basurero-men.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 540px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Men rest outside the walls of the dump.</i></p>
<p>
	Guatemala City&#39;s notorious street gangs, the <em>maras</em>, have far more power than NGOs n the basurero. On a good day, a guajero earns around 40 Quetzales ($5). However, the gangs regularly extort the workers for about half of their daily earnings, often leaving them with as little as $2.50 for an entire day of back-breaking labor.</p>
<p>
	The maras also prey on unattended children, recruiting them into extortion schemes and other illegal activities. &ldquo;This is a red zone,&rdquo; said Andrea. &ldquo;It&#39;s called a red zone because there is a lot of crime down here and gangs. And so, if you live in another zone, you don&#39;t want to come here for anything.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A lot of people know what&#39;s going on&hellip; but there are more who just don&#39;t have any idea,&rdquo; she added. In general, people simply try to avoid getting in trouble, and &ldquo;even when they know what&#39;s going on, they don&#39;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The police have a presence here, but they do little to maintain order or protect the community. Rape, theft, and child abuse are extremely common, according to people in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The police are bandits,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; told me when I visited him. He pointed to a patch of dirt near a dingy <em>tienda </em>selling chips and soft drinks. &ldquo;A man was killed right there,&rdquo; he told me. Police officers with shotguns stood barely 50 yards away. &ldquo;They did nothing,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; said, indicating the cops.</p>
<p>
	The officers stationed at the enormous green gates of the basurero are ostensibly there to prevent unlicensed workers and children from entering the dump&mdash;they have clipboards with lists of ID numbers&mdash;but large gaps in the wall and the thundering parade of garbage trucks allow guajeros to sneak in and out relatively unhindered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There are no records of how many people work there,&rdquo; Andrea said. &ldquo;We have had reports of kids still working there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144289/Basurero-children.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 822px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Children inside the door of one of the basurero&#39;s shacks.</i></p>
<p>
	When I visited the dump in an attempt to document conditions there, I was turned away at the gate by police and told I couldn&rsquo;t take pictures without a special permit from the city&mdash;a predictable result given the way the authorities have stopped information about the basurero from getting out.</p>
<p>
	Guatemala&#39;s press has largely failed to cover the humanitarian crisis in the neighborhood. What coverage there has been focused on the efforts of the fire department to control the blazes that periodically break out there&mdash;and reports do not mention, as Jos&eacute; did, that the fire smoldered for a month prior to the arrival of the fire department. There&rsquo;s very little attention being paid to the ugly conditions of day-to-day life in the basurero. Jos&eacute; believes that &ldquo;the government pays journalists not to write about the dump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In any case, it wasn&rsquo;t very difficult to dodge the police at the gates. I was able to photograph the gates of the dump from a moving car, and the city&#39;s public cemetery is perched precariously above the cliff wall of the dump&mdash;the vast hell-scape can be hazily seen through the smoke.</p>
<p>
	The public cemetery is where the vultures perch in between dives into the pit. It&rsquo;s a massive city of mausoleums where families rent shelves for the bones of their ancestors. In the past, if a family failed to make the annual $25 payment to the cemetery, the bones of their relative would be exhumed by the graveyard&rsquo;s management, and, according to some, chucked off the edge into the dump.</p>
<p>
	When I was there leaning out over the edge taking photos, I saw a relatively new SUV with &ldquo;Social Services&rdquo; blazoned on its side was parked at the cemetery gate. Vans like that are relatively common all over the city, but not in the basurero. Even the dead have better access to services than those laboring in the dump below. The scale of the dump is immense, and the pit is surrounded on all sides by cliffs, creating a suffocating, enclosed feeling. The effect is of a fetid mass grave, and the guajeros lurching from garbage pile to garbage pile look like the living dead.</p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Definitely haunted. All photos by Jon Manning.</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	As about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/02/real-ghosts-americans-poll_n_2049485.html"><span class="s1">45 percent of us know</span></a>, ghosts are <i>definitely</i> real and casually walk among us. Some have a post-life agenda of stealing our socks or manifesting as apparitions on burned toast; others prefer to spend their time banging around abandoned children&rsquo;s hospitals for Syfy Channel reality shows. But there&rsquo;s one ghost who has taken an industrious approach, choosing to operate a creepy Coca-Cola machine on an innocuous corner in Seattle&rsquo;s Capitol Hill. Like an endless <i>Encyclopedia Brown </i>story, the machine has been an ongoing source of curiosity and fear from locals for decades due to its weird location, outdated appearance, and reputation for being continuously and strangely stocked by a seemingly non-existent operator. It brings to mind the famous line from <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory </i>that gave entire generations of children the heebie jeebies: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLi-ellge1s"><span class="s1">Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out</span></a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">
	With its sun-bleached buttons and charmingly antiquated Mountain Dew logo, the Mystery Coke Machine has been spitting out sodas on the corner of John and Broadway for upwards of 15 years, but no one seems to know exactly for how long&mdash;or who re-stocks, maintains, or collects money from the thing. It&rsquo;s as though it fell out of a wormhole and landed free-standing onto this lonely corner. From the get-go, its 70s appearance evoked a sense of cheery yet ominous nostalgia, as if Matthew McConaughey&rsquo;s character from <i>Dazed and Confused</i> would fit right in with it, leaning against its side while he&rsquo;s busy winking at you. Prior to encountering it, you may not consider how unusual and even intimidating a vending machine looks standing alone on a sidewalk. It&rsquo;s almost as though it&rsquo;s forever waiting for something, or someone in particular, to show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Unlike its contemporaries that are characteristically flanked with buttons down their <a href="http://www.jaavending.com/images/soda-vending-machines-coca-cola-nj-ny.jpg"><span class="s1">right-hand-side</span></a>, its offerings are presented in horizontal rows at eye level. And here comes the creepy kicker: it has the standard offerings&mdash;cola, root beer, &ldquo;Dew&rdquo;&mdash;but also a whimsical, circusy-looking, fear-of-clowns-conjuring &ldquo;? Mystery ?&rdquo; button that results in a random selection. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean a random selection from the other drink choices; it means beverages so random that you couldn&rsquo;t even think of them if you were playing Scattegories. Upon recently bestowing the machine with three dollars, I received a Mountain Dew White Out, a raspberry-flavored Nestea Brisk, a Hawaiian Punch, and a Grape Fanta. It has also been rumored to birth Vanilla Cokes, Black Cherry Frescas, and Sunkist Cherry Limeade, among many other libationary oddities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144236/mystery-button-combined.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 258px;" /></p>
<p class="p2">
	Seeking answers, I looked to Broadway Locksmith, the establishment nearest to the machine. Merely a patch of grass and a handicap ramp away, I felt certain that they must have seen <i>someone</i> enacting some evidence of responsibility over the MCM, but they either genuinely have no clue or are feigning ignorance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen anyone open it,&rdquo; offers Mickey, the locksmith business&rsquo;s earnest-sounding general manager. &ldquo;Do people get soda out of it frequently?&rdquo; I ask him &ldquo;Oh yeah, all the time. All day long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; And yet in a decade-and-a-half, you&rsquo;ve never seen anyone tampering with it or refilling it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he shrugged, &ldquo;He must come in the middle of the night on a weekend or something.&rdquo; Or, as our theory states, the soda emissary could be a restless, undead spirit able to transcend the laws of space-time in order to supply an endless assortment of carbonated drinks.</p>
<p class="p2">
	Unconvinced that Mickey and his locksmith mignions had nothing to do with the machine, I pressed him for knowledge. &ldquo;Are you sure that you&rsquo;re not the one who collects money out of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I think they run on the same power as our address, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Mickey also claims that people often gather around the machine to stare at it with frightened wonder, or put entire rolls of quarters into its bowels in hopes of decoding its mystery-button logic. Where can you even get Brisk iced tea in a can anymore? Supposing that the operator of this mystifying appliance is a flesh-and-blood human being, it&rsquo;s truly admirable that he or she could evade the eye of the masses for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Or perhaps the operator of the machine isn&rsquo;t the ghost, but the machine itself. Where can we go anymore to receive something spontaneous &nbsp;and unexpected, rather than painfully customized, curated, tailor-marketed, and tech&rsquo;d to death? Coke&rsquo;s newest vending machine model, dubbed &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coca-colafreestyle.com/"><span class="s1">The Coca-Cola Freestyle</span></a>,&rdquo; claims to offer more than 100 quote-unquote made-to-order beverage choices, ranging from Caffeine-Free Diet Coke to Seagram&rsquo;s Cherry Ginger Ale to Powerade Zero Fruit Punch, even boasting an integrative app that allows you to find the nearest location, save your <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=suicide%20(drink)"><span class="s1">digital suicides</span></a>, and check in to earn &ldquo;badges.&rdquo; But all of this for soda personalization? Does this seem preferable to stumbling upon an aged vending machine on an unexpected curb and letting the powers that be choose your beverage fate? Surely, there is something to be said for the spirit of a good old-fashioned gamble&mdash;at least if the people of Seattle have anything to say about it, as they prostrate to the boxy idol with their loose change year upon passing year. Like a forgotten love song on the radio, an aluminum vial of Hawaiian Punch could never carry quite the same weight unless bestowed upon you by chance.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	But one notable amendment is that the price of the sodas in the mystery machine recently rose from 55 to 75 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Looks like even ghosts aren&rsquo;t exempt from inflation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photos courtesy of the White family</span></em></p>
<p>
	The night Victor White Sr.&rsquo;s son <a href="http://www.iberianet.com/man-dies-lsp-probe-starts/article_757fb56e-a3b8-11e3-8e81-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">died in the backseat of a cop car</a> in New Iberia, Louisiana, he called the local sheriff&rsquo;s station to figure out where his boy was.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I asked them if he&rsquo;d been apprehended, and they told me no,&rdquo; he said to me. It wasn&rsquo;t until the following morning, March 3, that Victor Sr. found out his son, Victor White III, had been arrested and died while in police custody. But he didn&rsquo;t receive the news from the New Iberia Sheriff&#39;s Department&mdash;he got the call from his son Leonard, who also lives in New Iberia and had been questioned that morning by police in connection with the death of his brother.</p>
<p>
	Immediately, of course, Victor Sr. made the two-hour drive from his home in Alexandria down to New Iberia to find out what the hell was going on. But the cops refused to tell him anything about the circumstances surrounding his 22-year-old son&rsquo;s death, citing an ongoing investigation by the state police. At that point, Victor Sr. had no idea his son&#39;s death was caused by a gunshot to the back while he was still in handcuffs in the backseat of a patrol car. Every official he talked to was cagey.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t even let me see the body,&rdquo; Victor Sr. told me over the phone. Eventually, when they realized he wouldn&rsquo;t take &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; for an answer, they brought in the coroner and allowed Victor Sr. to take one look at his deceased son&mdash;but even then, they had conditions. &ldquo;They told me I couldn&rsquo;t see his lower body,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I could only see his face.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Still completely in the dark about what had taken place, Victor drove back home in utter shock. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t until I got back and looked on the state police&#39;s Facebook page that I found out what had happened to my son.&rdquo; Even then, the official version of events opened up even more questions than answers.</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s what is known at this point: On Sunday, March 2, Victor White III walked down to a convenience store with a friend to pick up a cigar. When he got there, a fight broke out&mdash;it&#39;s unclear if Victor and his friend were involved, but in any case the cops arrived on the scene shortly after the fight ended, stopped Victor a couple blocks from the store, and discovered that he had some unidentified narcotics on him. They cuffed his hands behind his back and put him in the back of their cruiser&mdash;and that&#39;s where the story stops making much sense.</p>
<p>
	The sheriff&#39;s deputies who arrested Victor III allege that when they arrived at the Iberia Parish Sheriff&#39;s Office, Victor III wouldn&#39;t leave the car and became &ldquo;uncooperative.&rdquo; They say he pulled out a handgun, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, and shot <em>himself</em> in the back.</p>
<p>
	I called the state police and the local sheriff&#39;s office to ask questions about whether Victor&#39;s last moments were caught on video, who the officers in question are, and how a suspect in police custody could have had a gun after being frisked, but no one would comment anything of substance since the shooting was being investigated. (This is standard operating procedure at police departments.)</p>
<p>
	Lieutenant Anthony Green, however, was willing to give his take on New Iberia&#39;s response to the shooting, stating, &ldquo;The community is not really up in arms about this. I don&#39;t sense any large unrest.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This isn&rsquo;t the first time the Iberia Sheriff&#39;s Department has been suspected of brutalizing the people of New Iberia. Last year, a group of officers were caught on video beating a handcuffed man at the town&#39;s annual Sugar Cane Festival, an incident that led to a <a href="http://www.wdsu.com/news/around-louisiana/iberia-parish-deputy-fired-following-sugarcane-festival-incident/22363726">deputy&rsquo;s firing</a>. And at least a few activists are upset by this history of mistreatment. On March 11, Reverend Raymond Brown, a fast-talking New Orleans preacher, <a href="http://www.iberianet.com/news/brown-coverup/article_9e05a7b8-a9f9-11e3-8d4c-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">hosted a small rally</a> in New Iberia and called for the US Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Victor&#39;s death.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We believe they murdered him,&quot; he told me over the phone. &quot;They shot him in the back and then drove him to the sheriff&rsquo;s office. We don&#39;t buy the police&rsquo;s story. If he&#39;s handcuffed around the back, it would be impossible for him to reach down and grab a gun like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144263/victorwhiteiii.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 498px;" /></p>
<p>
	To those close to Victor III, the claim that he would try pull out a gun and shoot himself while in the custody of police is just absurd.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He was a respectable person. He went to church. It&rsquo;s so unusual for them to say he was &lsquo;uncooperative.&#39; And for them to say he shot himself, that&rsquo;s just unbelievable,&rdquo; said Victor Sr. &ldquo;I saw his face. I <em>know</em> they beat him before he arrived at the station, because those who were with him before he was arrested said he didn&rsquo;t have a mark on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	According to his father, Victor III&#39;s previous run-ins with the law were minor&mdash;the kind you&#39;d expect of any young man: He was caught once with pot, he got a traffic violation for making a U-turn a while back, and when he was 16 he broke someone&#39;s window. Local police officials, however, would not elaborate for me on Victor White III&rsquo;s criminal record, once again citing the ongoing investigation. But Victor Sr. said that at the time of his death, Victor III was getting his life on track: He&rsquo;d moved down to New Iberia in November to be with his girlfriend and his six-month-old daughter and was living out of a hotel called the Cajun Inn with one of his brothers, his girlfriend, and his baby. He&rsquo;d taken a job at the local Waffle House, but his long-term plan was to go to vocational school for welding. The day Victor III died, he told his dad over the phone that he was planning on using his $800 income tax refund, which he was carrying around that night in cash, to get a permanent home for his girl and his baby. Everything seemed to be falling in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Outraged and dissatisfied, Victor Sr. and his family have banded together to try and get to the bottom of what happened to Victor White III. They&rsquo;ve hired attorney Carol Powell Lexing, who gained statewide recognition for her work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Six">Jena Six</a> case. Severely skeptical of the state investigation and the local police, Victor Sr. and the White family have also created a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/7ductk" target="_blank">campaign to raise funds</a> for an independent autopsy and crime-scene tests. Simply put, they&#39;re tired of waiting to hear from the police.</p>
<p>
	&quot;My family has <em>no</em> closure, because there are all these&nbsp;questions still looming over us,&quot; Victor Sr. said to me in a moment of reflection and lamentation. &quot;I&#39;m just in disbelief. I still call out his name. I still think I&#39;m going to wake up from this nightmare.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>UPDATE: </strong>According to the White family&#39;s lawyer,&nbsp;Carol Powell Lexing, there is video footage that confirms Victor III was not involved in the fight outside the New Iberian convenient store, which caused the police to arrive on the scene and stop and question him.&nbsp;</p>
