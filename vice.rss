	<i>An anti-mining banner at the roadblock reads: &ldquo;Defend our Mother Earth from the rats.&rdquo; </i></p>
<p class="p1">
	<span style="float:left;color:black;font-size:47px;line-height:35px;padding-top:7px;padding-right:5px;font-family: Arial;">I</span>n 2000, engineers from Radius Gold, a Vancouver-based mining company, discovered a belt of gold deep inside the Tambor mountains in southern Guatemala. The Guatemalan government promptly issued the company an exploratory license, and for more than a decade, Radius studied the region as a possible base of operations. The proposed mine lies just a few miles from the village of San Jos&eacute; del Golfo and from San Pedro Ayampuc, a small city. Few locals, most of whom are of indigenous Mayan descent, were consulted before Radius moved in. Few of them knew anything was happening at all. They certainly didn&rsquo;t know they were living atop what would become a literal gold mine.</p>
<p class="p1">
	It wasn&rsquo;t until early 2012 that townspeople began to grasp the scope of what was happening just down the road. They watched as truck after truck, loaded with heavy equipment, rumbled down the winding jungle roads that were normally used as routes for <i>colectivo</i> buses and small pickups carrying crates of chickens. In February 2012, Radius obtained final permission from the government to build its mine, which it hoped would pump out as many as 52,000 tons of gold a year. Fearful of what might happen if a big foreign developer started digging into their soil, the community decided to intervene. They formed a human roadblock, manned in rotating shifts by people sitting on plastic chairs. They held banners, and cooked on-site meals for protesters in a makeshift kitchen under a lush canopy of vegetation. The mine has yet to extract a single ounce of gold, and March 2 of this year marks the second anniversary of this roadblock, known as La Puya, which translates to <i>the Point</i>&mdash;as in the tip of a spear.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">

<p class="p1">
	The human roadblock was the culmination of decades of frustration with the destructive and lucrative mining industry in Guatemala. The industry has benefited the national coffers since the country opened up to foreign mineral extraction in the mid 1990s. But that wealth rarely trickles down to those living in close proximity to the mines, who are the most affected by the damage to the local ecosystem. In San Jos&eacute; del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc, where most residents earn a living as sweet-corn farmers or chicken ranchers, the fear was that the arrival of large-scale industrial mining would suck up and contaminate the local water supply, drying up natural springs, depleting the water table, and polluting it with arsenic.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I visited La Puya in July 2013, after hearing about the many attacks the roadblockers had withstood over the course of the previous year. Five months after La Puya was formed, Radius Gold sold its exploratory license to Kappes, Cassiday &amp; Associates (KCA), a mining company based in Reno, Nevada. The human roadblock drastically increased the risk of the investment, but the structure of the sale was such that Radius wouldn&rsquo;t be paid in full until the mine started producing. This incentivized both companies to get rid of the activists and start digging up gold. In December 2012, the mining companies hired police and private security who arrived en masse at the roadblock and delivered an ultimatum to the protesters: Clear the road, or be removed by force. Steadfast and resolute, the protesters didn&rsquo;t budge&mdash;even when the security detail fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. Instead, the roadblockers lay flat on the dirt road, holding flowers up to the riot-gear-festooned police.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Members of La Puya meet with Guatemala&rsquo;s president, center, and interior minister, right.<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	That official attempt to move the roadblock was somewhat chaotic but still respectful of the rule of law, oversimplified as a case of the state wielding its power as a cudgel against protesters illegally blocking a road. But months earlier, Yolanda &ldquo;Yoli&rdquo; Oquel&iacute; Veliz, one of the leaders of La Puya, had gotten a far more acrimonious visit.</p>
<p class="p1">
	On the night of June 13, 2012, as she was driving home from the roadblock, two masked gunmen followed Yoli on motorbikes and shot at her multiple times. &ldquo;I still have the bullet in my back,&rdquo; Yoli told me when I interviewed her at La Puya&rsquo;s camp on a calm, sunny day in July. She craned her neck and pointed at a raised mound of flesh near her kidney.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Although many are undocumented, attacks like the one Yoli survived are all too common. Anti-mining encampments pepper the Guatemalan countryside, and attacks by private security organizations have been reported all over the country. One such case occurred in April 2013, at southeast Guatemala&rsquo;s Escobal silver mine, which is owned by the Canadian-founded company Tahoe Resources. Tahoe&rsquo;s head of security gave orders to open fire on protesters who had been blockading the road near the mine, according to an investigation by Guatemalan newspaper <i>Siglo 21</i> a month later. Six people were badly injured, and the head of security was recorded on tape giving the order to shoot, allegedly saying, &ldquo;Kill those sons of bitches.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Guatemala&rsquo;s president, Otto P&eacute;rez Molina, right, and interior minister, Mauricio L&oacute;pez Bonilla<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	Following the attacks, people from nearby villages began setting vehicles on fire. Riots broke out. Guatemala&rsquo;s president, Otto P&eacute;rez Molina, imposed a &ldquo;state of siege&rdquo; for 30 days, a legal move that gave the military the right to impose martial law on the areas around the mine. The community&rsquo;s blockade was dissolved, and Tahoe has been extracting silver on a commercial scale since January 2014, having begun operations in September last year. According to the company&rsquo;s press materials, Escobal is now poised to become the largest silver mine in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Guatemala sits atop a wealth of natural resources&mdash;nickel, gold, silver, and titanium&mdash;that lie beneath the country&rsquo;s rich volcanic soil. In 1960, the Canadian-owned and -operated International Nickel Company (INCO) became the first transnational mining company to arrive in Guatemala. That year also marked the beginning of a 36-year civil war between the government and a slew of leftist guerrilla groups fighting over land distribution, indigenous rights, and economic equality. The conflict ended in 1996, after sweeping neoliberal economic changes were enacted and many regions of the country previously controlled by rebels were opened up to the mineral-extraction industry.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Since then, the government has granted more than 400 licenses to multinational corporations, and the terms for these companies are exceptionally favorable. The government rarely receives more than 5 percent of a company&rsquo;s earnings, and under the leadership of President P&eacute;rez Molina, corporations pay the government only 1 percent of the value of the minerals they extract. They also get to use local water at no cost. <i>Mineral exploitation </i>is a technical term for the process of mining, and in a very literal sense, communities like those near La Puya are being exploited for their gold, their water, and their wealth, with mining often leaving behind a thoroughly pillaged landscape that is utterly bereft and toxic.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>A farm overlooking the Escobal silver mine<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	On June 12, 2013, I was invited, along with ten representatives of La Puya, to the National Palace in Guatemala to speak with the country&rsquo;s president and its interior minister. The goal was to strike an agreement between activists and the government. The demonstrators at La Puya are the only community-based activists to have been invited to the National Palace for such a meeting. Unbeknownst to them, however, the president had also invited KCA in an attempt to open up dialogue between the two opposing sides. Yoli was furious and refused to speak with KCA executives. Which made perfect sense, considering her explicitly stated objective was the cancellation of all mining licenses within their territories.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;This decision can only be made by the government of Guatemala and therefore cannot be discussed with KCA,&rdquo; she told P&eacute;rez Molina. He thought about this for a minute before asking members of KCA to leave the room, after which the president, the interior minister, and the representatives of La Puya spoke. One of the main issues discussed was an environmental-impact study previously executed by KCA. The study found the environmental and ecological risks posed to areas surrounding the mines to be of relatively low impact&mdash;a conclusion that has since been discredited by several reputable geologists. La Puya successfully argued its case, and the meeting concluded with P&eacute;rez Molina&rsquo;s promising that a second, fully independent study of the effects of mining on the area would be commissioned by the government. In the meantime, KCA was ordered to suspend its operations.</p>
<p class="p1">
	At the moment it felt like a small victory. But as of press time, the promised environmental-impact study has yet to be commissioned, and the scale of attacks against villagers near the mine has increased.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>The day shift at La Puya&rsquo;s encampment<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	I returned to Guatemala in early December 2013 and visited San Jos&eacute; de Nacahuil, a tiny village about 15 miles from La Puya. On September 7, 2013, 11 people were killed and 28 more were injured there when masked gunmen with automatic weapons stormed the village&rsquo;s main street and opened fire on businesses. Authorities and local newspapers reported that the shootings were gang-related, but the community disputed this charge.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I drove up to San Jos&eacute; de Nacahuil on a single-lane road and talked to local residents. They showed me the cafeteria where ten of the victims from the September 7 attacks had died. Bullet holes riddled the wall. Later, an elderly woman led me to a spot where gunmen had allegedly chased a man and shot him before dragging his body back to the caf&eacute; and dumping him with the others.</p>
<p class="p1">
	According to many residents whom I interviewed, police invaded the small community hours <i>before</i> the massacre, to intimidate and harangue them. After the police had left, the gunmen arrived, tracing the same route as the officers and targeting the same businesses the police had visited.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" border="0" height="445" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/under-the-volcano/group-photo.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>The community of La Puya in peaceful resistance<br />
	</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	Villagers believed that there had been an escalation of the mining corporations&rsquo; intimidation tactics, which now bore all the hallmarks of police collusion and a militia-style subjugation of locals fighting against the degradation of their environment. Their strategy was now one of preemption; police and thugs had shifted their attention from disbanding already-established roadblocks to disrupting nearby communities that might rally to the cause.</p>
<p class="p1">
	It seems that the resistance to mining efforts in this area of rural Guatemala&mdash;and the associated violence&mdash;won&rsquo;t be stopping anytime soon. La Puya might be celebrating its second anniversary, but some protesters are facing criminal charges and trials as their attackers go largely unpunished.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Yoli, the woman who was shot in the back near La Puya, went to court in February 2014, along with six of her fellow protesters from the roadblock. They were charged with kidnapping, coercion, and intimidation, allegations that their supporters claim are false. As of press time, a verdict has not been reached, but to the mining companies it&rsquo;s something of a victory: It has kept Yoli in a courthouse, far away from the roadblocks.</p>

<title>Italy&#039;s Newest Tabloid Is Devoted Entirely to the Pope </title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/italy-has-a-tabloid-magazine-dedicated-to-the-pope</link>
<pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140656/cover-IL-MIO-PAPA1.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 435px;" /></p>
<p>
	Ever since Pope Francis became the leader of the Catholic Church last year, the mainstream press has gone nuts. Since his ascension to the top of the Vatican, Jorge Mario Bergoglio (his pre-pope name) has been called a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/pope-francis-gentle-revolution-inside-rolling-stones-new-issue-20140128" target="_blank">revolutionary</a>,&rdquo; a &ldquo;<a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/07/26/like-a-rock-star-pope-francis-calls-for-disorder-in-rio/" target="_blank">rock star</a>,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;<a href="http://www.thewire.com/culture/2014/01/pope-francis-promoted-rockstar-super-hero/357503/" target="_blank">superhero</a>.&rdquo; He was also proclaimed to be a living saint for performing a miracle only a few hours after his investiture in March 2013&mdash;when he managed to make Rome&rsquo;s public transportation <a href="http://www.leggo.it/vaticano/papa_francesco_i_romani_ringraziano_primo_miracolo_metro_e_bus_funzionano/notizie/219632.shtml" target="_blank">work properly</a> (for a couple of hours, at least).</p>
<p>
	That was just the beginning. After suffering through the reign of notoriously non-media-friendly Pope Benedict (although his red <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/22/AR2005122201914.html" target="_blank">Prada shoes</a> made regular headlines), Italian journalists couldn&rsquo;t believe their luck when they realized there was finally a pope who regularly <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2293785/Pope-bus-Francis-shows-hes-man-people-hops-board-minibus-church-day-job.html" target="_blank">rode the bus</a> and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/22/pope-brazil-carries-own-luggage_n_3634674.html" target="_blank">carried his own bag</a> and who wasn&rsquo;t immune to the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/pope-francis-cancels-audiences-due-illness-133413038--finance.html" target="_blank">flu</a>.</p>
<p>
	So Pope Francis had already been on plenty of magazine and tabloid covers before March 5, when the first issue of <em>Il Mio Papa </em>[&quot;My Pope&quot;], a weekly magazine devoted to his holiness, hit newstands. <em>Il Mio Papa</em>&#39;s editor is Aldo Vitali, who is also behind Italy&rsquo;s bestselling TV listings and celebrity news magazine, <em>TV Sorrisi e Canzoni </em>[&quot;TV Smiles and Songs&quot;], and the <a href="http://www.mondadori.it/Media/Comunicati-stampa/2014/MONDADORI-LANCIA-IL-MIO-PAPA-IL-PRIMO-SETTIMANALE-AL-MONDO-INTERAMENTE-DEDICATO-A-PAPA-FRANCESCO" target="_blank">official press release</a>, announced that <em>Il Mio Papa </em>would have<em> </em>&ldquo;a positive and popular point of view, with colorful layouts and highly emotional pictures.&rdquo; The publisher, Mondadori (which is owned by the family of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi) has high hopes for the publication, as it has an announced circulation of 3 million and a PR campaign that includes banners in St. Peter&rsquo;s square in Vatican City.</p>
<p>
	(It may or may not have been inspired by a photoshopped parody of <em>Tiger Beat </em>that featured Pope Francis that was on the website of left-wing magazine <em>Mother Jones </em><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/03/latest-news-tiber-beat" target="_blank">over a year ago</a>.<em>)</em></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s sort of odd to launch a new weekly magazine at a time when the print media is supposedly dying, but Vitali seems to believe that the pope&#39;s appeal can overcome publishing trends. In a letter to his readers, the editor wrote: &ldquo;The Pope never stops&mdash;every day he surprises us with his firm decisions and his unpredictable gestures... If you are reading these lines it means that we have something in common: an admiration and deep appreciation for Pope Francis.&rdquo; <em>Il Mio Papa</em>, he continued, will aim not so much to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; the world&#39;s top Catholic, but to &ldquo;help him spread his message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I leafed through the first issue (it&#39;s 68 pages long and costs 50 cents) to get a sense of what that looks like, and found that the tone of the articles was generally, &ldquo;The pope always hugs the children passed to him by their parents,&quot; and, &ldquo;Often mothers ask for a kiss for their child and the pope is always surrounded by children who are happy to be next to him,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Pope Francis is constantly showing his enthusiasm for his devotees, and St. Peter&#39;s Square is everyone&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The best part is the photos that resemble the candid celebrity shots commonly found in tabloids, except instead of D-listers groping C-listers in taxis, you get Pope Francis &ldquo;walking among the happy crowd&rdquo; in St. Peter&rsquo;s square. You also have pope-related news items, like the one below (at left) about how there&#39;s going to be a TV show inspired by the pope&#39;s life in Argentina between 1976 and 1981, &ldquo;when he opposed Jorge Rafael Videla&rsquo;s regime, helping the underprivileged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140585/p17-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 177px;" /></p>
<p>
	After the &ldquo;political&rdquo; section (bo-ring!), <em>ll Mio Papa </em>advises readers on how to enjoy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelus" target="_blank">Angelus prayer</a> in St. Peter&#39;s Square (&ldquo;you can see the pope better from the first quarter of the square, on the right&rdquo;) and offers glimpses into the pope&#39;s personal life; he&#39;s &ldquo;declined to live in the Papal apartments&rdquo; and &ldquo;prefers to live in a hotel room.&rdquo; That one comes with a map of the papal apartments that looks like a children&#39;s book illustration:</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140586/p28-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 314px;" /></p>
<p>
	Readers can also treat themselves to a pull-out centerfold of the pontiff that could decorate &ldquo;your room or your place of work&rdquo; so that &ldquo;the pope&#39;s smile and prayers will always be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Toward the end you&#39;ll find a photo story about the pope&rsquo;s first year in Vatican, in which you can spot the selfie he took with some kids in August 2013, captioned &ldquo;A technological pope.&rdquo; A few pages later you can find a guide to signing up for Twitter in order to &ldquo;receive Francis&rsquo; messages on your phone (it&rsquo;s easy and free)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Page 55 is by far my favorite. Headlined &ldquo;Francesco Helps Us,&rdquo; it maps out the components of the Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;five-finger prayer&rdquo; (for an English explanation of the five-finger prayer, <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/yimcatholic/2013/09/too-cool-not-to-share-pope-franciss-five-finger-prayer.html" target="_blank">click here</a>).</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/35d5bfb07fa9aa137b075560ce409296/tumblr_n1yomyoBZT1skgqflo1_1280.jpg"><img class="embeddlr_photo" src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/35d5bfb07fa9aa137b075560ce409296/tumblr_n1yomyoBZT1skgqflo1_400.jpg" /></a></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Via <a href="http://laprivatarepubblica.tumblr.com/post/78640873816/oggi-in-edicola-ce-il-mio-papa-settimanale" target="_blank">Tumblr</a></em></p>
<p>
	The magazine&#39;s ads make it clear that <em>Il Mio Papa</em>&#39;s target demo is older people who are having troulbe pooping. &ldquo;&#39;Kilocal Woman&#39; helps you fight weight gain&rdquo; reads one. &ldquo;Wake up your bowel and fight constipation&rdquo; is another tagline, and not far away is &ldquo;Re-charge your bowel with good bacteria.&rdquo; There are also ads for hearing aids, beauty creams, and products that make &ldquo;your legs look like they did when you were 20.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	What does the actual pope think about <em>Il Mio Papa</em>? Well, judging from this <a href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/14_marzo_04/vi-racconto-mio-primo-anno-papa-90f8a1c4-a3eb-11e3-b352-9ec6f8a34ecc.shtml" target="_blank">interview</a> with newspaper <em>Corriere della Sera,</em> he&#39;s not very happy&mdash;he told the interviewer that he doesn&rsquo;t want to be portrayed as a superhero or a rock star, because he&#39;s still a man that &ldquo;laughs, cries, sleeps calmly, and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Good luck with that, dude.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	Why isn&rsquo;t everything more messed up? Everything is always the wrong kind of messed up, tangibly messed up, like big-box stores or an entire television network dedicated to 24-hour-a-day celebrity coverage. When I was in second grade, this kid Cory told me his uncle had gotten his head cut off by a Ouija board because he wasn&rsquo;t treating it right, and I haven&rsquo;t slept well since. That&rsquo;s the sort of messed up I want. I want to find art that makes that feeling seem like one of a million, not one in a million. I want a shitload of witches on my stoop with some candy and some diagrams of the insides of human bodies.</p>
<p>
	That stuff is still out there; it&rsquo;s just not easy to find. Here are two new little spell books.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144729/SCARECRONE.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 957px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong><em><a href="http://publishinggenius.com/?p=2559">Scarecrone</a>&nbsp;</em>by Melissa Broder</strong></p>
<p>
	If you&rsquo;ve ever read Melissa Broder, or if you&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/melissabroder">follow her on Twitter</a>, you know her spirit is entrenched somewhere halfway between the club and the void. There&rsquo;s an odd balance of metaphysical transcendence and material bling-brain to quite a number of her lines, and she is unafraid to have her idea of God bump shoulders with both blood and Tumblr.</p>
<p>
	Broder says shit like: &ldquo;Nobody bleeds white like I bleed white / Into a ditch the shadow of my bloodbag is white / I want a darker aura, like I want to be gorgeous.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a weird brand of inner loathing mashed with inner haunting lurking here, but what I like best about Broder, oddly, is her morality. As coal-black as her imagery gets, and as overriding as the sadness in her ongoing personal desolation might be, there is an unrelenting sense that there&rsquo;s a reason for it. That humans, perhaps, carry hell because they are hell, and that really the self is just a vessel toward something no one really has a name for.</p>
<p>
	That Broder wields this, and isn&rsquo;t just pumping out poems full of wry cartoon loathing and social exuberance, shifts the center of the book not onto the self but onto something larger, undefined. I don&rsquo;t know what a book is if not a latch to elsewhere, and <em>Scarecrone</em> has pressed its skull against the hidden door. It is neither drunk nor ecstatic to be here&mdash;it is a state unto itself.</p>
<p>
	<strong>SELF-PORTRAIT AS SATAN</strong></p>
<p>
	My wings are made of garbage</p>
<p>
	At least they can be touched</p>
<p>
	I want you I want you</p>
<p>
	Especially the old and ugly</p>
<p>
	Take these bottles of soda</p>
<p>
	And tubes of cherry lipstick </p>
<p>
	These are my demon breakfast </p>
<p>
	And my red red hooves </p>
<p>
	It is better to be satan </p>
<p>
	With half-trash filling </p>
<p>
	Than try to stuff your holes with clouds</p>
<p>
	Lacerating on your nails </p>
<p>
	I once stuffed my holes with halos </p>
<p>
	Until honey dripped down </p>
<p>
	The honey smelled like village women </p>
<p>
	Full of want and feces </p>
<p>
	Village women screaming out for anything alive</p>

	I shut them up with jars of eye cream </p>

<p>
	<strong><em><a href="http://www.calamaripress.com/Niceties.htm">Niceties: Aural Ardor, Pardon Me</a>&nbsp;</em>by<em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>Elizabeth Mikesch</strong></p>
<p>
	From the very first sentence of <em>Niceties</em>, Elizabeth Mikesch&rsquo;s first book, you know you&rsquo;re in for something Beckettian: &ldquo;Would we say that we would go a ways to the place of the one who we could never name?&rdquo; Among those who talk about the music of a sentence, there are at least two kinds: those who like the music to do all the work, to the point where you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Please, kill me, I want to hear no more,&rdquo; and those, like Mikesch, for whom the music is just a cover for what is more like a series of hundreds of eruptions, one after another.</p>
<p>
	Like <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/diane-williams">Diane Williams</a> and Noy Holland, here is a person who can take any sort of world and make it work. Whether it&rsquo;s the complex image of a dad telling his daughter it&rsquo;s time to shave her vagina, or kids picking lice out of each other&rsquo;s hair, the context is like a gel&mdash;a thing in and of itself rather than described or played out for entertainment.</p>
<p>
	The subject matter floods past in currents that run deep as any corridor. &ldquo;I got robbed,&rdquo; one narrator mentions sidelong, before taking her roommate to task in the next sentence for leaving her panties all over the place, and then in the next to mentioning how she keeps a bunch of knives beside her bed. There is no whimsy here: Each paragraph is a slab of wicked meat. You might have only 87 pages, but each is worth at least a couple other volumes, and even if you&rsquo;re not sure where you ended up it still keeps tingling, like getting a hex put on you. Or sleeping with a Ouija board.</p>
<p>
	<strong>&ldquo;Under Doors of Foreigners&rdquo; (from <em>Niceties</em>)</strong></p>
<p>
	What I don&rsquo;t know about a house is which dream I will have sleeping inside of its strange beds, above its pallets when I am guest again.</p>
<p>
	I know that my mother made French fries for father at four a.m. in her mother&rsquo;s house, and it made her mother&rsquo;s house burn down. She fell asleep and the grease burned up even the family photos.</p>
<p>
	I know there are houses I have slept in where I&rsquo;ve been bitten by spiders for closing my eyes. People eat spiders in their sleep every year they say. I think that&rsquo;s why I am always sleepy but never can. I also think a house can have a room that is so much of one person that you know them now so much you will finally sleep after all. Sometimes somebody wants you to be the room they fall asleep in so much that you never will.</p>
<p>
	I slept in a foreigner bed once, a mother and father&rsquo;s. They had two huge crosses above their headboard. I had a new tattoo. Their son laughed at my arm during dinner but covered his mouth. I didn&rsquo;t give more than one word before bed. Above where he slept, he had pictures of pigtailed girls and, too, of cartoons. I didn&rsquo;t understand the soap there, but I wanted to wash around where I started to sweat. I was scared about the ink, and there were so many bloody statues that I stayed awake feeling their marriage all over me.</p>
<p>
	There were gold-framed photos of their loved ones on either side protecting them. I wrapped my arm in a scarf and watched until the son woke up.</p>

<p class="p1">
	I live in a city and I&rsquo;ve never seen a water well. It sounds exotic, or even fictional. I just turn on my faucet, water comes out, and I don&rsquo;t have to consider its source.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Here in the eastern United States, we&rsquo;re doing OK when it comes to precipitation, but our West Coast neighbors are seriously suffering from a terrible drought. California&mdash;often referred to as our nation&rsquo;s &ldquo;breadbasket&rdquo; because it grows <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/">nearly half</a> of all domestically produced fruits, vegetables, and nuts&mdash;is deep into its second year of reduced rainfall, the likes of which the state hasn&rsquo;t seen since the 70s. That much food on the line means a lot of profits are in danger. With this year&rsquo;s drastically reduced crop yields, food prices across the country are rapidly increasing. In the next few months, the prices of artichokes, celery, broccoli, and cauliflower could rise by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-07/california-drought-impact-seen-spreading-from-fires-to-food-cost.html">10 percent</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p1">
	These high stakes are making California farmers both desperate and creative, because they&rsquo;re looking for ways to find water underground since it refuses to fall from the sky. A couple of weeks ago, an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/02/water-witches-california-drought_n_4885092.html">article</a> about &ldquo;water witches&rdquo; caught my eye. The piece described so-called witches in California using the <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Dowsing-or-Divining-Rods">age-old technique</a> of the divining rod&mdash;usually just a tree branch&mdash;to tap into energy fields below the surface of the land to locate groundwater and pinpoint where to drill wells. This common practice, also known as dowsing, has been around since at least the 15<sup>th</sup> century and has been also used to unearth precious metals, gravesites, and oil reserves. In spite of its popularity, witching has long been stigmatized. In 1518, Martin Luther thought the notion of walking around with a wooden stick in the woods was completely freaky, and decried it as occultism. Seventeenth-century France even put strict limitations on water witches. But while scientific bodies such as the <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/edu/dowsing.html">US Geological Survey</a> claim that witching is about as successful at finding water as pure guesswork, it continues, after many, many centuries, to remain popular: Winemaker Robert Mondavi, a practicing water witch himself, has popularized the practice in California&rsquo;s vineyards, and even John Franzia&mdash;the Two-Buck Chuck guy&mdash;advocates dowsing.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	I wanted to hear about witching firsthand, so I called Sharron Hope, the president of Gold Country Dowsers, the Oroville, CA&ndash;based chapter of the <a href="http://dowsers.org/index.php">American Society of Dowsers</a>. Hope, who has been dowsing in California since the 70s, said that in recent years her business has more than quadrupled. Just don&rsquo;t call her a witch.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>VICE: When you go out dowsing for water, how exactly does that work?</b><br />
	<b>Sharron Hope:</b> I head to the property, I find a tree branch, and I hold it out in front of me. Then, I turn around in a circle, and when the branch senses energy, it&rsquo;ll start dipping down towards the earth, but just minutely&mdash;you have to really concentrate on what you&rsquo;re doing; you have to forget about everything else, just relax and turn slowly, and when you feel that dip, you walk in that direction. When you get over the site where there is the most water, that stick is gonna point down to the earth.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>You say &ldquo;when the stick senses energy.&rdquo; What kind of energy are we talking about here?</b><br />
	Water, of course, is flowing underground, and it&rsquo;s flowing past rocks, and rocks actually store energy. So as it goes through those rocks, the water strips off some of that energy&mdash;some of those electrons&mdash;from the rocks. And that energy goes shooting straight up. That&rsquo;s what the tree branch, up on the surface, is responding to. I started doing water wells in 1979. And I&rsquo;ve noticed over the years that there are heavily-traveled deer trails over water veins. And a lot of times, when I go out to dowse, the spot that I find to drill the well is where two deer trails cross. So wild animals, too, can pick up on that energy that comes up from the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>The process sounds kind of supernatural. Is that where the name &ldquo;water witch&rdquo; comes from?</b><br />
	Actually, the name comes from the fact that a lot of dowsers, historically, used a branch from the witch hazel tree to find water. But the overall term is dowser&mdash;you know, we don&rsquo;t like to be called water witches, actually. It provokes snide comments. It&rsquo;s really just an old-fashioned term that people used 100 years ago.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144728/dowsing.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 873px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>An old-school dowser. Photo via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Otto_Edler_von_Graeve_4786745367_04b089ec26_b.jpg" target="_blank">Wiki Commons</a></i></p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>It sounds like dowsing has a long history.</b><br />
	As far as we can figure out, the practice goes back at least 10,000 years. There are actually petroglyphs of men holding a tree branch and looking for water. And of course, before we had machinery and drilling rigs, we had to hand-dig wells, so you better believe they had some kind of methods to find the water. And basically, most of &#39;em just used a tree branch.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>OK, so back to the branch. Once you find your spot, what do you do?</b><br />
	I&rsquo;ll mark that spot, and then I&rsquo;ll get my L-rods out. They&rsquo;re made of solid brass, and they have a copper handle. So I&rsquo;m holding on to the handles, and I&rsquo;m standing a little bit away from the site that the branch found. And I move towards that site, and I get right over it, and then those two L-rods will cross.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>So they&rsquo;re sort of drawing together of their own accord?</b><br />
	Yes, they go together of their own accord. They cross and make an &ldquo;X.&rdquo; And if I back up again and walk around that site, maybe about 8 to 10 feet away from it, as I get to a water vein, those rods are gonna separate and make a line. That indicates the edge of the water vein. So that&rsquo;s the process that I use. In fact, I was out dowsing a well in Berry Creek today for a family who bought ten acres out there, and they want to have a well for a little family garden. And last Thursday, I was out at a vineyard&mdash;it was almost 200 acres, and I dowsed several well sites for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Do vineyards make up a lot of your clientele?</b><br />
	Oh, I have a variety of clients. A lot of homeowners around here have property with acreage, and for a lot of them, their wells have either gone dry because of the drought, or the water table has gotten so low that they&rsquo;re not getting enough out of their wells to run their households. We have rice farmers around here, and I&rsquo;ve dowsed wells for them. We have a lot of agriculture around here. I&rsquo;ve done organic orchards, citrus farms, olive orchards&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot that I&rsquo;ve done in the past 35 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<b>Has your business increased in the past couple of years because of the terrible drought?</b><br />
	Oh, definitely, definitely. For most of my career, I&rsquo;d been dowsing about one well a month. Now I&rsquo;m doing anywhere from one to four a week.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Do you get calls from people who had never heard of dowsing before?</b><br />
	Yes, the well-drillers are actually referring people to me. Because the well-driller, you know, he just drills a hole. He says, &ldquo;Where do you want me to drill your well?&rdquo; And at $15&ndash;50 a foot for drilling, you don&rsquo;t really want to have to guess at where he should start drilling&mdash;you want to know.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<b>Thanks, Sharron.</b></p>

	<font face="Arial" size="1"><span style="line-height: 16px;"><i>A fire at the Chevron oil refinery in Richmond, California, forced 15,000 people to seek medical attentiion. Photo courtesy of <a href="http://ellabakercenter.org/">Ella Baker Center for Human Rights</a>.</i></span></font></p>
<p class="p1">
	Richmond is tucked into California&#39;s western tricep, a former wine town with a population just over 100,000. Under the administration of Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, the town is the <a href="http://www.gp.org/greenpages/content/volume11/issue1/elections1.php">largest city in the United States with a Green Party mayor</a>. It&rsquo;s also an oil town&mdash;in 1901, Standard Oil set up a tank farm, choosing the location for its easy access to San Francisco Bay. Soon after, a western terminus of the Santa Fe Railroad was built in Richmond to handle the outflux of crude. Over the course of the 20th&nbsp;century, Standard Oil became the Standard Oil Company of California (SOCAL), and later, Chevron.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Throughout the 90s, the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~snre492/sherman.html">Richmond refinery was fined thousands of dollars for unsafe conditions, explosions, major fires, and chemical leaks</a>, as the plant oozed chlorine and sulfur trioxide into Richmond&rsquo;s atmosphere. In August of 2012, <a href="http://www.csb.gov/chevron-refinery-fire/">the Richmond refinery exploded</a>&nbsp;after Chevron ignored the warning of corroding pipes from the local safety board. The disaster was linked to aging pipes, which were simply clamped instead of replaced altogether. Some&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Richmond-sues-Chevron-over-refinery-fire-4703370.php">15,000 residents in the surrounding area were forced to seek medical treatment</a>, and Chevron&rsquo;s CEO, John Watson, <a href="http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_23005441/chevron-ceos-pay-jumps-30-percent-32-2">got a $7.5 million dollar raise</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" scrolling="no" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/QiILbGbk8Qk" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p class="p1">
	Now that some time has passed, Chevron has decided to modernize the refinery and has simultaneously sponsored the creation of the&nbsp;<a href="http://richmondstandard.com/"><em>Richmond Standard</em></a>, an online newspaper that is decidedly positive about anything the company does. The paper, whose name is a sly reference to the company that Chevron grew out of,&nbsp;covers minimally reported local stories on crime, public meetings, and sports. It also features a section called &quot;<a href="http://richmondstandard.com/category/chevron-speaks/">Chevron Speaks</a>,&quot; which works as a place for the company to put forth its ideology. <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/New-Chevron-website-covers-Richmond-news-5339356.php">According to&nbsp;<em>SF Gate</em></a>, &quot;the idea of the nation&#39;s second-largest oil company funding a local news site harkens back to an era of journalism when business magnates often owned newspapers to promote their personal, financial, or political agendas. Now that mainstream newspapers are struggling to survive, online news sites are testing ways to fund their operations.&quot;</p>
<p class="p1">
	The founding of the <em>Standard</em> coincides with a modernization initiative at the facility that would allow it to process fuel with higher percentages of sulfur, the key to the corrosion that resulted in the 2012 plant explosion. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re planning on doubling the sulfur content of the crude,&rdquo; Andres Soto, the Richmond community organizer at Communities for a Better Environment, told me.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	According to Soto, Chevron wants to go from 1.5 percent sulfur content to 3 percent. Outside of the fear of another explosion, there is a serious environmental problem with the modernization and the refinery in general. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re publically claiming there will be no net increase in emissions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Our suspicion is they plan on releasing more greenhouse and particulate emissions, here in the local area, in exchange for cap and trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	For those of you unfamiliar with cap and trade, it&rsquo;s essentially when you let one of your refineries pollute above the federal limit in exchange for another refinery polluting below the federal limit. The differentials from &ldquo;caps&rdquo; are traded so that in the end everyone is supposed to be meeting requirements, on average. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the single largest refinery on the West Coast of the United States. As a facility, it&rsquo;s the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases in California,&rdquo; Andres says. He believes that the refinery will cause serious pollution in the Bay Area, and that the company will start using the port of Richmond to ship tar sands to China that aren&rsquo;t legal for fuel in the United States because of the sulfur content.</p>
<p class="p1">
	As you may have heard in relation to the <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tar-sands-and-keystone-xl-pipeline-impact-on-global-warming/"><span class="s2">Keystone Pipeline proposals</span></a>, tar sands are semi-solid petroleum-and-sand mixtures that are being harvested in Alberta, Canada. The process of extracting the petroleum wastes a lot of water, <a href="http://e360.yale.edu/feature/with_tar_sands_development_growing_concern_on_water_use/2672/"><span class="s2">and a Yale article</span></a> reported last year that a company extracting petroleum used 370 million cubic meters of fresh water in 2011. Chevron could export the sands to China for their needs and save Americans time and resources, but Andres points out the emissions from shipping and the emissions China will create will circle back to America with the winds.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Chevron is attempting to convince the public that the refinery is a good idea in the pages of the <em>Richmond Standard</em>, typically using the <a href="http://richmondstandard.com/category/chevron-speaks/"><span class="s2">promise of more jobs</span></a> and more money. Andres says the company is buying every billboard in town. The billboards often depict people of color, likely in an effort to convince minorities that they can trust a multinational oil conglomerate.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Richmond is <a href="http://richmondca.areaconnect.com/statistics.htm"><span class="s2">about a quarter Latino and a third African American</span></a>, so there is a big population for Chevron to market to with these advertisements. Andres believes that, regardless of race, the low economic standing of many Richmond residents risks the town being subject to anything that creates jobs. He also believes that Richmond is becoming more progressive, and that people will hopefully spend more time educating themselves on the issues.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Not only is the company buying up all the billboards, but in 2010 the company spent <a href="http://www.mayorgayle.net/e-newsletters/2012Nov2.htm"><span class="s2">$1.2 million</span></a> on city council elections, and Andres claims they spent an additional $2 million on the California state legislature. In November, five out of Richmond&#39;s seven council seats will be opening, including the mayor&rsquo;s seat, and that appears to be why they&rsquo;re plastering the town with billboards.</p>
<p class="p1">
	A company like Chevron is more than willing to spend all the money it can to ensure the operation of its biggest refinery in California. Whether it means starting a newspaper or sponsoring elections, they seem capable of doing anything necessary for their project. Chevron did not return my calls, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d have plenty of jargon about jobs and economic growth for me. There may be a lot of jobs in oil, but there aren&rsquo;t any jobs at all when the town you live in is on fire.</p>

<p>
	Westboro Baptist Church founder and world-famous bastard Fred Phelps <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/fred-phelps-has-died">died last week</a>&mdash;and it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;ll be missed even by a large part of his large family (he had&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps" target="_blank">13 children and 54 grandchildren</a>), who still make up <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/24/pastor-fred-phelps-westboro-baptist-church-louis-theroux" target="_blank">a large part of what remains of the WBC</a>.</p>
<p>
	So far, more than <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/god-hates-fags-preacher-fred-phelps-founder-of-the-infamous-westboro-baptist-church-dies-9205898.html" target="_blank">20 members</a> of the Phelps family have left the church due to his behavior and WBC&#39;s practices.

Having completely denounced the WBC dogma, Nathan now lives in Canada, calls himself an atheist, and is an avid supporter of LGBT rights. He has also spent the past few years giving speeches and interviews about his experience as a member of WBC.</p>

	Back in 2012, I had the honor of having Nate stay as a guest in my house for a few days. Once I heard about his father&#39;s death, and with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NatePhelps/posts/10151924300961765?stream_ref=5" target="_blank">Facebook announcement</a> Nate made about it in mind, I got in touch with him again.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: Hey, Nate. How do you feel about your dad dying?<br />
	Nathan Phelps: </strong>I haven&#39;t seen my father in over 35 years. I spoke to him once, briefly, in 1995. Ten years after I left home, I went through a deliberate mourning process for the loss of my family. Between that and the passage of time, I believed I would have no feelings when he passed. I was surprised that there were feelings when I learned of his condition and then his death. I&#39;ve now had a few days to consider those feelings, and I think the sadness is over what might have been.</p>
<p>
	<strong>When you revealed that your father was dying a few days ago, you said family members that left the church were being blocked from seeing him. If you had been able to, would you have wanted to see him one last time in person?</strong><br />
	In a perfect world, I would have jumped at that chance. I left that place 37 years ago as a fearful young man. The absence of interaction, an opportunity to process that, only means I still have that fear to contend with. If there were the least bit of evidence that our relationship had changed in his eyes, I would be there in a heartbeat. Other than that, my greatest concern was for my family members who had expressed a desire to see him and were being denied that opportunity.</p>
<!--recommended--><p>
	<strong>So far, that famous Facebook update of yours from a few days ago has 2,000 comments. I read quite a few of them, and there seemed to be a divide between those who wanted to leave comments celebrating his death and those that felt this would be disrespectful to you as his son&mdash;even likening it to picketing a funeral. Given that you were one of his biggest critics while he was alive, what are your thoughts on this?</strong><br />
	They [the WBC] have done great harm to many people. I cannot expect all of them to be prepared to forgive and forget just because he stopped breathing. Having said that, I don&#39;t condone fighting hate with hate. I am fond of something the British philosopher Bertrand Russell said near the end of his life: &quot;The moral thing I should like to say is, love is wise and hatred is foolish.&quot; These are not interesting words on a sign, but a way of approaching life and other humans morally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>You sometimes tweet at your sister Shirley. Does she or any of the other family members who are still in the church ever respond to or communicate with you?</strong><br />
	Rarely, but I&#39;ve heard from most of them at one time or another. The interesting thing about those encounters is that we discover quite early on that we have no basis for debate because I roundly reject the foundation for their entire worldview, the divine inerrancy of the Bible.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You revealed that your father had been excommunicated a few months ago by the church he founded. Do you know if this was an indication of any significant changes at the WBC? What do you think will become of it now?</strong><br />
	This is tough to answer with any certainty. I&#39;ve heard he was kicked out because his personality had changed, and he was treating the family and other church members cruelly. You will allow me to pause for a moment of bitter laughter at that one. That rationale should have seen him excommunicated 60 years ago. But I digress. The other thing I heard is that he was at odds with a newly formed board of eight elders regarding the direction of the church and this led to his excommunication.</p>
<p>
	Having said that, it&#39;s not clear if it was a complete excommunication or a forced removal from his position as pastor. Some things I&#39;ve heard from family members suggest that they turned their back on him in the end. Other comments lead me to believe that he was still, in their eyes, in good standing with God.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What effect do you think his death will have on the family? Do you foresee it changing any of their relationships with you?</strong><br />
	I won&#39;t hold my breath. I do believe that the new dynamics will be very, very difficult to sustain. There is evidence that an outsider, Steve Drain, holds significant power. That same power in my father&#39;s hands encompassed so much more than Steve could ever match. If they keep bleeding young members from their flock, I have to believe they will reach a tipping point that will fracture what&#39;s left. Stay tuned.</p>

<title>What Really Happened During Mexico City&#039;s Airport Shoot-Out?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/what-really-happened-during-mexico-citys-airport-shootout</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:29:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144711/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-11-35-12-AM.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Deputy Chief Luis Cardenas Palomino at his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZdVKqCSEw">press conference</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	At 8:33 in the morning on Monday, June 25, 2012, the sound of gunfire erupted in Terminal 2 of the Mexico City International Airport. The shots were coming from the direction of the food court. Witnesses recalled seeing two separate groups of gunmen, both clad in the dark navy uniforms of the Mexican Federal Police. Travelers and airport personnel dived for cover underneath the neat rows of small round tables.</p>
<p>
	Altogether, three policemen died at the scene, according to the Federal Public Safety Department, whose uniforms all of the shooters in question were wearing. The two men dressed as police but designated as villains fled the airport on foot.</p>
<p>
	The shoot-out at the Mexico City International Airport remains one of the most singularly bizarre, alarming, and, above all, unexplained events of the drug war.</p>
<p>
	Among the dead was the bodyguard to the chief of federal police at the airport, the shift supervisor for land transportation at the terminal, and a patrolmen on duty that morning. The Federal Police were unsure whether the men responsible for their deaths were police, ex-police, or impostors. They were later identified as two patrolmen, dirty cops, the chief said, caught red-handed in a drug deal involving an anonymous network of cocaine traffickers based in Lima, Peru.</p>
<p>
	Apart from the body count, almost nothing about the official version stands up. The deputy chief of the Federal Public Safety Department, Luis Cardenas Palomino, attributed the shoot-out to a satchel of drugs hidden in an airport men&#39;s room. When one of the dirty cops brought it out, that was the signal to move in for the arrest. So then why did 44 minutes elapse on the time-stamped video from the time that a blurry figure is pictured entering a restroom to the moment that a nondescript figure is pictured at the top of the stairs where he will be detained? Why is the satchel of drugs not clearly pictured in any of the still images presented as evidence? Where did it go when the suspects ran away, their arms unencumbered?</p>
<p>
	It was a drug deal with no evidence of drugs; a special operations team of three officers, all of whom ended up dead; a special operation every moment of which somehow eluded the 430 security cameras filming every inch of the airport at the time, without the knowledge of the airport security personnel who monitored them.</p>
<p>
	Last week, members of the airport&#39;s video-surveillance team leaked never-before-seen footage of the shoot-out to the Mexican news weekly <em>Reporte Indigo</em>. The new footage exposes Deputy Chief Palomino and the Federal Public Safety Department for selectively choosing video and still images to substantiate the story&mdash;of a special operation of good cops busting bad cops&mdash;that they wanted to transmit to the public.</p>
<p>
	The new footage shows that Deputy Chief Palomino hid from the public the fact that a second shoot-out occurred in the airport only about a minute after the two patrolmen had already fled. <em>Reporte Indigo </em>cited anonymous sources close to the investigation who believed the patrolman was most likely killed during the second shoot-out, when the suspects were out of the building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The footage from 2012 shows the two shooters escaping through the food court at 8:33 AM. In his presentation to the media, Deputy Chief Palomino stops the tape there, at the point time-stamped 8:34:30. The last movements are of terror-stricken patrons of the food court beginning to pick themselves up off the floor. By choosing to stop the footage there, it gives the appearance that the violence was over.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144718/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-11-58-45-AM.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /><br />
	<em><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">A still from the security footage used by Deputy Chief Palomino</span></em></p>
<p>
	The new footage, however, continues rolling past that point where the deputy chief had stopped the tape. A mere six seconds later, bullets fly in the food court once again.</p>
<p>
	What did The Federal Public Safety Department have to gain by hiding the fact of a second shoot-out? Certainly, the notion that one group of police was secretly planning to arrest the other could not have survived otherwise. A closer look at the new footage also reveals that more Federal Police were involved in the shoot-outs, and the operation appears larger and more premeditated than previously thought.</p>
<p>
	The new footage introduces previously unknown characters into leading roles in the shoot-outs. Two unidentified federal police officers appear in one new scene. They are shown leaning against a railing in a busy passageway between the food court and the gates for international flights. It is only a few minutes before the first shoot-out will begin. A civilian wearing a ski mask approaches and greets them, shaking hands. He then crosses to the other side of the busy passageway and greets others at the edge of the frame before disappearing off camera.</p>
<p>
	The officers display a nonchalance that amounts to a kind of premeditation. Moments before the shooting commences, one of the policemen moves away from the railing and walks over to within a few yards of where the first shots are fired. As panic sets in, and the travelers and employees of the airport are seen running for their lives, the second officer moves without haste to a large screen in the middle of the frame, which he steps behind and which blocks the camera&#39;s view of him. His partner returns showing no sign of panic, and both men can be seen speaking on their cell phones as they observe the unfolding action. Neither of them so much as unholsters his firearm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	A similar figure appears immediately after the second shoot-out in the food court. He is another federal policeman, emerging briefly from a hiding place behind a giant decorative potted plant in the middle of the seating area. Like the others hiding behind the screen, this man seems to be aware of where the security cameras are. He too is seen speaking deliberately into a cell phone, emerging from hiding only momentarily to assess the scene. When a detachment of federal police arrive on camera, they patrol away from the direction in which the shots were fired, rather than toward it.</p>
<p>
	A week after their escape, the two patrolmen accused of gunning down three of their fellow police reached out to the Mexican news magazine <em>Proceso </em>to tell their version of the story. Daniel Cruz and Zeferino Morales admitted guilt in the deaths, but denied they were involved in drug trafficking.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;And we know that we are going to pay for that, but we cannot acknowledge the other charges because we never got involved in drug trafficking,&rdquo; Cruz said. &ldquo;It is very clear who protected drug trafficking and who provided the protections. [The deceased policemen] always used to say that they got along well with Chief Palomino and that they had it all on a silver platter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	So what are we to make of all this? A quick rundown of the recent criminal history at the airport is enough to suggest that the shoot-out most likely arose from a dispute between rival cliques of corrupt police over the spoils of drug trafficking. As recently as 2008, the then-chief of the federal police, Edgar Millan, was shot to death in his home in Mexico City. One of the suspects was a former anti-narcotics police officer at the airport, and he had in his possession a notebook with detailed information about drug trafficking there.</p>
<p>
	Less than a year before the shoot-out, a pilot with Aeromexico was caught at Madrid&#39;s airport with 92 pounds of cocaine in his personal luggage. Eight months prior to that, three flight attendants with Aeromexico were caught with more than 300 pounds of cocaine between them. A company providing private security at checkpoints in Mexico City International Airport were also arrested in connection with that case.</p>
<p>
	The airport is known as a transshipment hub for South American cocaine headed to Europe, as well as a recipient of bulk cash deliveries from the United States.</p>
<p>
	Officers Cruz and Morales remain fugitives. They said they would turn themselves in when there is a&nbsp; change in the presidential administration. That change happened in December, but neither man has been heard from. The reward for their capture is around half a million dollars. The third man, their shift supervisor, whom they said had nothing to do with the airport shoot-out, was captured and charged on July 15, 2012. In August, 348 federal police officers at the Mexico City International Airport were replaced and reassigned to other states.</p>
<p>
	The replacements were police officers who passed a double scrutiny, and an exhaustive vetting process, according to a statement that Chief Palomino made at the time. But only time will tell when the next scandal&mdash;or shoot-out&mdash;occurs.</p>

<title>Peru&#039;s DVD Pirates Have Exquisite Taste</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	In Pasaje 18<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of Lima&#39;s&nbsp;Polvos Azules shopping<strong>&nbsp;</strong>mall, you&#39;ll find racks of DVD burners humming away while fluorescent lights cast their glare across the glitter of thousands of bootleg movies&nbsp;in&nbsp;telltale cellophane wrappers. It looks like a scene right out of cyberpunk. But for many Peruvians, whose access to alternatives like Netflix is hampered by <a href="http://www.netindex.com/download/2,51/Peru/" target="_blank">some of the slowest internet speeds on the globe</a>, bootleg DVDs&nbsp;remain a primary source for accessing current movie releases.</p>

It hasn&#39;t always been that way;&nbsp;As&nbsp;a shop owner named El Chino told us, &quot;I had problems with the law about 11 years ago. They&#39;d stop by and confiscate my films.

<title>CAN-FAP Is Fighting for Foreskins Everywhere</title>

	<em><span class="photo_caption">CAN-FAP leader Glen Callender. All photos courtesy of James Loewen via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/james.loewen.75/media_set?set=a.10151975168281937.1073741860.649731936&amp;type=1" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	The majority of the Western world has already come to the conclusion that female genital mutilation is bad&mdash;it&rsquo;s brutal, invasive, and causes children unbelievable amounts of pain for no reason. Meanwhile, male genital mutilation, a.k.a. circumcision, is hailed as a great way to prevent everything from venereal diseases to cancer. The benefits of circumcision are still being debated, so medical associations refrain from condemning or supporting the practice for the most part, and generally leave the decision up to a child&rsquo;s parents. But plenty of anti-circumcision activists want the procedure banned altogether, like the Canadian organization called <a href="http://www.can-fap.net/" target="_blank">CAN-FAP</a>, which stands for the Canadian Foreskin Awareness Project.</p>
<p>
	The foreskin-loving group organized a protest last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, during a TED Talk featuring Bill and Melinda Gates. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has been <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/HIV#bodyregion_0_interiorarticle_0_strategysections_2_strategysubsections003d5bb5b7d94917b0e1fc15987e4745_3_lnkHeader" target="_blank">donating millions of dollars</a> to programs that offer circumcision in Africa as a preventative measure against HIV, which has led CAN-FAP to dub Bill Gates &ldquo;Foreskin Enemy #1.&rdquo; I caught up with Glen Callender, the organization&#39;s founder, to ask him what he was thinking when he named his organization, among other things.</p>
<p>
	<strong>VICE: First off, what&rsquo;s with the name, CAN-FAP?</strong><br />
	<strong>Glen Callender</strong>: Well, a lot of people seem to think it&rsquo;s a mistake. But of course it&rsquo;s deliberate, and it&rsquo;s a reference to the history of circumcision in the Western world. It began as a non-religious surgery in the 1800s to primarily prevent boys from masturbating. The foreskin is, of course, a built-in masturbation aid, and that&rsquo;s the way nature intended it.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How did CAN-FAP get started?<br />
	</strong>I started CAN-FAP in June 2010. The main motivation for it was that I have a really enjoyable foreskin. My foreskin actually has its own orgasms, and it feels fantastic every day of my life. When I was a kid and I learned about circumcision for the first time, I already had a very good relationship with my foreskin, and the idea horrified me. That horror has never left my system&mdash;just knowing that little boys are being strapped down and having this valuable, enjoyable part of their penis cut off. The men who have foreskins know that it&rsquo;s a good body part, it&rsquo;s valuable, and that there aren&rsquo;t bad parts of the penis. This is an ancient, religious, superstitious idea. There are no bad parts of the penis, and there are no bad parts of the female vulva. It&rsquo;s all good, and we shouldn&rsquo;t be tampering with the sexuality of children and the adults they grow up to be. We understand, because we&rsquo;re not accustomed to it, that female genital mutilation of any kind is child abuse. You&rsquo;re taking a sharp object, and you&rsquo;re deliberately causing pain and bleeding and amputation to a child&rsquo;s genitals. Well, we do the same thing with boys, and we need to stop doing it. Knives and genitals of children should have nothing to do with each other. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a boy or a girl or if you cut a little or a lot&mdash;taking a knife to the genitals of a child is sexual abuse.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Are there any health benefits to circumcision?</strong><br />
	The circumcision rate in some countries is less than 1 percent, so if circumcision improves men&rsquo;s sexual health, we would see men getting sick in Europe because of their foreskins. But it turns out that the sexual health of intact European men and their female partners is as good as or better than the sexual health of their circumcised counterparts. It&rsquo;s really bullshit. It&rsquo;s all about making parents scared so they&rsquo;ll hand over their babies to be circumcised so doctors can make their money. They know if a boy grows up, when he&rsquo;s 18 years old, there&rsquo;s no way he&rsquo;s going to want a knife near his penis, because any man would be crazy to want less penis.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s like, if you saw them plucking out a kid&rsquo;s eye, you would be horrified because you have an eye and you know how wonderful an eye is. But then you have the parents saying, &ldquo;No, no, no, we come from a religion that believes that there&rsquo;s one evil eye, and you pluck that eye out! And it&rsquo;s fine having one eye; you can still see.&rdquo; And you go, &quot;Shut up! You&rsquo;re plucking out a kid&rsquo;s eye and taking away a sense organ from him. You&rsquo;re taking away part of his body that he uses to interact with the world and enjoy life.&quot; I feel the same way about my foreskin. I have a foreskin, and frankly, that makes it clear that all the arguments for circumcision are bullshit.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144427/canfap2-000.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 410px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>Can you tell me why you&rsquo;re calling Bill Gates &ldquo;Foreskin Enemy #1&quot;?</strong><br />
	Through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bill Gates has committed over $145 million to circumcising as many African men and boys as possible. And there are hints that they might actually be prepared to spend up to a billion dollars on this, as these programs scale up in different countries. That makes Bill Gates personally responsible for more unnecessary circumcisions than any other individual in the world. He has exterminated more foreskin than anybody else, and that is why he is Foreskin Enemy #1. It&rsquo;s just an embarrassment in the 21st century&mdash;the idea that we should be making up reasons to cut off healthy, normal parts of people&#39;s bodies is insane.</p>
<p>
	The studies that Bill Gates uses as a basis for this funding really make circumcision look good. The results show a 50 to 70 percent reduction in HIV transmission over a short period of time, and that&rsquo;s the thing in some cases: Even if it works, it&rsquo;s over a short period of time, not long-term. The bottom line here is that real-world populations don&rsquo;t reflect that data. If circumcision really did prevent VDs, population data would consistently show that circumcised populations had fewer VDs than the intact, but that&rsquo;s not the case. The United States proves this within its own borders. They had the biggest HIV epidemic in the Western world there among an almost completely circumcised male population.<br />
	<br />
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144428/canfap3.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	<strong>Why did people start messing with penises in the first place?</strong><br />
	It started out as a preventative measure against masturbation, because they believed in Victorian times that masturbation caused all sorts of health problems. Then it became used as prevention against venereal diseases, then cancer&mdash;they always make it [a cure for] whatever the scary thing is. Today it&rsquo;s HIV, so lo and behold, circumcision prevents HIV! And in the future, if a new venereal disease emerges that we haven&rsquo;t yet heard of, well, they&rsquo;ll say that circumcision prevents that too. But really, for cultural and religious and financial reasons, they want to cut off your foreskin. It is a billion-dollar industry in the US: About 3,000 boys a day are circumcised, and that earns pediatricians over a billion dollars a year. And there are billions more in hospitals, and the fact that foreskins get sold into the biotech industry and get used to create skin grafts and used to create collagen and other ingredients for beauty creams&mdash;the bottom line here is that this is not an ethical industry.</p>
<p>
	And what a coincidence that the part that&rsquo;s being cut off is on the most enjoyable part of your body. You know, God doesn&rsquo;t want a knuckle, or the index toe off of one of your feet, or a bit of your earlobe, no. He wants part of your penis. Your genitals are supposed to be your happy place, and religion wants to make them your unhappy place, your shame place.</p>
<p>
	<strong>You do something called the </strong><strong><a href="http://www.can-fap.net/sra/sra.shtml" target="_blank">Foreskin Pride Salute</a>. C</strong><strong>an you explain it?</strong><br />
	Explain it? Well, first of all, you can&rsquo;t have a circumcised T-shirt. You&rsquo;ve got to have a long-sleeved shirt that goes all the way down to your wrists. And you make a fist with your hand, which symbolizes the head of the penis, and you tuck that fist away into the sleeve of your shirt and heroically extend your arm skyward and pull back that sleeve to reveal the fist. And that is very symbolic. I hope that intact men around the world will adopt the Foreskin Pride Salute to show the world that intact men are proud of our foreskins and we love them. The problem is in your head, not on my penis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Anything else to add?</strong><br />
	I&rsquo;d like to add that black foreskin is beautiful.</p>

<title>New York City Politics Is Still a Bunch of Warring Ethnic Tribes</title>

<p>
	Though he was seemingly invincible after cruising to a landslide win over a joker of a Republican opponent in November, nowadays Bill de Blasio, the onetime progressive messiah and current New York City mayor, is struggling. Polls <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/nyregion/de-blasios-approval-dips-though-his-personal-marks-remain-high.html?hpw&amp;rref=nyregion&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">show</a> his approval rating has sunk below 50 percent, and it&#39;s clear he&#39;s finding it impossible to satisfy the city&#39;s hodgepodge of competing ethnic factions and interest groups jockeying for influence. He&#39;s still polling relatively well among blacks and Hispanics, but whites are downright skeptical, with a plurality expressing pessimism about the city&rsquo;s future under the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/nyregion/a-mayoral-hopeful-now-de-blasio-was-once-a-young-leftist.html" target="_blank">Sandinista-in-chief</a>. So after a mayoral race that appeared to unite the city&mdash;de Blasio won more than 70 percent of the vote, the most of any candidate in decades&mdash;his most committed supporters are naturally a bit nervous that the <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/new-yorkers-welcome-bill-de-blasios-leftist-utopia" target="_blank">left-wing utopia</a> they were promised is in serious jeopardy.</p>
<p>
	Some of the mayor&#39;s growing pains are natural given that his campaign was about calls for social progress, but his tenure so far has been full of the headaches inherent in mundane tasks like deciding whether or not to close city schools in anticipation of snow. Erstwhile fans of Barack Obama will recall how miserable the first few weeks of each term were, when the hope generated by his inspiring campaigns gave way to economic teams <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/big-moneys-obama" target="_blank">littered with alumni</a> of Wall Street megabanks. De Blasio, who has spent most of his career as a Democratic political strategist, is playing the game by the same rules as everyone else&mdash;so far, he&#39;s made shameless appeals to every tangible constituency while publicly saying <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/03/why-de-blasio-is-softening-on-charter-schools.html?mid=google" target="_blank">most of the right things</a> to soothe the powerful elites who look back fondly on the days of Michael Bloomberg&#39;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704107204574472892886003298" target="_blank">luxury city</a>.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He is doing exactly what he said he would do and for the constituency that elected him,&rdquo; said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran NYC Democratic political consultant. &ldquo;New York City politics was ethnic before it was racial, and it has always been tribal: groups in competition with each other for limited resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	(We recently got a refresher in this dynamic from a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/nyregion/they-kept-a-lower-east-side-lot-vacant-for-decades.html" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> investigation</a> that showed how Sheldon Silver, now the speaker of the state Assembly, blocked affordable housing for decades in a temporarily successful bid to preserve the Jewish identity of the Lower East Side&mdash;and with it, his own political power.)</p>
<p>
	Beloved by minorities and white liberals, de Blasio was never going to keep three quarters of America&rsquo;s largest city happy, not with an ambitious reform agenda that has already produced one of the more progressive paid-sick-leave laws in the country, which the mayor <a href="http://observer.com/2014/03/bill-de-blasio-signs-his-first-bill-at-brooklyn-ice-cream-factory/" target="_blank">signed</a> triumphantly at an artisanal ice cream factory in Brooklyn last week. Its beneficiaries will <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/poor-and-hispanic-workers-are-least-likely-to-have-sick-days/284232/" target="_blank">overwhelmingly</a><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/03/poor-and-hispanic-workers-are-least-likely-to-have-sick-days/284232/" target="_blank"> </a>be black and Latino, and the same goes for de Blasio&#39;s universal, government-funded pre-kindergarten initiative, which <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/state-senate-proposes-540-million-pre-k-plan-article-1.1721208" target="_blank">appears likely</a> to come to fruition (albeit not by way of taxing the rich, as the mayor hoped) after months of maneuvering by Governor Andrew Cuomo and state legislators in Albany.</p>
<p>
	Meanwhile, one group the mayor has yet to deliver any real goods for is the city&#39;s Muslim community, which was <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/ray-kellys-path-to-becoming-americas-big-brother" target="_blank">systematically surveilled</a> by the NYPD under Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Ray Kelly. We still don&#39;t know what will become of New York&#39;s global anti-terrorism apparatus: John Miller, the former journalist and press flack whom current police commissioner Bill Bratton tapped to head up the department&rsquo;s Intelligence Division, <a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/03/8542459/brattons-lament-sympathetic-council" target="_blank">told</a> the City Council last week that he was having a hard time getting a handle on his new domain.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;To be honest with you, when I said I want to see our policies for intelligence collections and investigations, it was hard to get a hold of them. When I finally got them, [the manual] stood a foot tall,&rdquo; Miller said when asked about Muslim surveillance. He suggested that an internal review of surveillance practices would take months to complete. In the meantime, an NYPD inspector general will be named in a matter of weeks, offering the prospect of at least some kind of police oversight. Even with that delay, Muslim and Arab American advocates who supported de Blasio&#39;s campaign are heartened by conspicuous outreach from Bratton and his deputies&mdash;they never got that kind of attention under Bloomberg.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;So far, they&rsquo;re putting the lie to the idea that you can either have a safe city or a decent one,&rdquo; said Eugene O&rsquo;Donnell, a former Brooklyn cop and prosecutor who advised de Blasio&rsquo;s campaign on criminal justice policy and was involved in his transition this winter.</p>
<p>
	But balancing concern for the groups traditionally on the fringe of city life with the need to avoid upsetting more powerful interests like Brooklyn&#39;s massive and politically influential Orthodox Jewish community (which de Blasio has been <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/149311/de-blasio-ultra-orthodox-support" target="_blank">courting</a> for decades) will be tricky. There are a handful of Orthodox operatives with prominent roles in his administration, but so far, at least, no visible presence for Muslim or Arab Americans with the exception of Sherif Soliman, former communications director for the NYC Employees&#39; Retirement System, who was chosen to act as the mayor&#39;s voice in Albany (which speaks to a desire to reassure conservatives in the Orthodox world more than anything else).</p>
<p>
	&quot;Many of those who feared a bomb-throwing radical have been pleasantly surprised by his appointments,&quot; said David Luchins, a professor at Touro College in Manhattan and an expert on the city&#39;s Orthodox community.</p>
<p>
	You can&#39;t keep everyone happy all of the time, however, and de Blasio has quickly made his share of outright enemies. Charter-school advocates like former councilwoman&nbsp;<a href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/01/8539382/what-now-eva-moskowitz" target="_blank">Eva Moskowitz</a>&nbsp;think he&#39;s on a quest to destroy them on behalf of his allies in local teachers&#39; unions. Everyone from actor Liam Neeson to the AFL-CIO is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/de-blasio-s-horse-drawn-carriage-ban-faces-hurdles-1.7441812" target="_blank">miffed</a>&nbsp;at his insistence on banning horse-drawn carriages. And a botched handling of one of this winter&#39;s many storms&nbsp;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/01/upper-east-side-ny-post-bully-de-blasio.html" target="_blank">nearly sent</a>&nbsp;the Upper East Side into outright rebellion&mdash;and provided the right-wing <em>New York Post</em>, which accused de Blasio of <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/71761/bill-de-blasio-s-a-commie-claims-super-reputable-new-york-post" target="_blank">being a commie</a> during the campaign, with another chance to call him incompetent.</p>
<p>
	His low approval ratings are likely frustrating to de Blasio&#39;s team, because New Yorkers actually <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-steep-learning-curve-article-1.1714716" target="_blank">agree with him on most issues</a>. The easy part, they&#39;re finding out, was getting their guy elected&mdash;the hard part is figuring out how to force everyone to get along.</p>

<title>This Death Row Inmate Is Dying to Donate His Organs</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/this-death-row-inmate-is-dying-to-donate-his-organs</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144442/longo-.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 499px;" /></p>
<p>
	In 2001 Christian Longo killed his wife and his three young children and fled to Mexico. Once he was brought back to the US, he was convicted of those murders and placed on Oregon&rsquo;s Death Row, where he has resided since 2003. He was <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/the-federal-bureau-of-investigation-today-placed-christian-michael-longo-on-its-ten-most-wanted-fugitives-list" target="_blank">once on</a> the FBI&#39;s top-ten most wanted list, and James Franco is even going to play him in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/business/media/true-story-is-based-on-the-conning-of-a-shamed-journalist.html?ref=christianmichaellongo&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">an upcoming movie</a>.</p>
<p>
	Christian, now 40 and still in jail, is turning a new leaf. In an effort to give back to his community, he has decided to donate his organs upon his inevitable execution. The only problem is, due to the lack of an efficient prisoner donation protocol, he pretty much can&#39;t. Chris is even willing to forgo all appeals of his death sentence if he can donate his organs upon his execution. Still, he&#39;s been denied.</p>
<p>
	Through his Gifts of Anatomical Value from Everyone (<a href="http://www.gavelife.org/">G.A.V.E</a>) organization, Chris is looking to change that. The mission of G.A.V.E is to remove the medical and ethical issues involved with prisoner organ and tissue donation and gain approval for some of the 2 million incarcerated individuals to donate. If successful, the organization will substantially reduce the number of people on waiting lists for organ and tissue donation (which is <a href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/" target="_blank">more than 121,000</a>,&nbsp;according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network).</p>
<p>
	I recently conducted an email interview with Longo about how he came to found G.A.V.E, the work his organization is doing, and the impact prisoner donation could have if certain ethical and political barriers were removed.</p>

<p>
	<strong>VICE: What piqued your interest in prisoner organ donation?</strong><br />
	<strong>Christian Longo: </strong>After watching a friend increasingly suffer from a degenerative disorder called scleroderma, it became apparent she would eventually need a kidney transplant. After being told by my prison system that consideration may only be given for donations to immediate family, I put together a proposal for my unique circumstances as a death row inmate. I offered to end my remaining appeals and face execution if my healthy body parts were able to be donated to those in need. My request was denied.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How surprising was it to find out you couldn&rsquo;t donate?</strong><br />
	It was a Spockian &quot;that&#39;s illogical&quot; moment followed by a fear that someone I cared about might not be able to find a suitable donor... which pissed me off.</p>
<p>
	<strong>When and why was the ban of prisoner donations instituted?</strong><br />
	It&#39;s not a ban per se, but there&#39;s enough red tape that it might as well be. Due to inadequate testing, infections such as HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C were being transplanted with the organs. Prisoners along with gay men, hemophiliacs, and intravenous-drug users were all listed in the CDC&#39;s <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031670.htm" target="_blank">donor exclusion recommendations</a>.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What&#39;s changed since?</strong><br />
	In 1994, the risk of contracting HIV was <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00040737.htm" target="_blank">much greater</a>&nbsp;in prison than it was for the general US population. I think the problem lies in testing methods. In the early 90s testing procedures were unable to detect the virus accurately. Now we have RNA testing, which can detect the virus within days of infection.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Who allows prisoners to sign up to donate organs? Any prisoner donations yet?</strong><br />
	Utah became the first state <a href="http://vitals.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/13/17674231-new-utah-law-allows-organ-donations-from-prisoners-nearly-250-sign-up?lite" target="_blank">to legislate</a> the right of prisoners to be donors last year, and they now give inmates the opportunity to register as donors upon entry to prison. To date, about 1,000 of the 7,000 prisoners in Utah&#39;s correctional system have signed up. Texas and Maricopa County, Arizona, also allow prisoners to register as donors.</p>
<p>
	Thus far, I&#39;m not aware of any registered inmates who have donated. The problem has been that even in states that technically allow donation, they only allow donations after death. Prison security issues slow this process down prohibitively, to a point of death for the organs... and any hopeful recipient. Until prison policies are adjusted accordingly, living donation opportunities, like kidneys and bone marrow, have to be considered.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What about societal aversion to donations from prisoners? And is that present on the recipient level?</strong><br />
	Unofficial polls <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3388804/#R9" target="_blank">reflect</a> that over 70 percent of respondents feel that prisoners should be able to donate. I encourage anyone to swing by any local dialysis clinic to ask if they would accept an inmate&#39;s organ, even one on death row.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What are the ethical and medical risks, if any, for these types of procedures?</strong><br />
	Certainly, the care that can be taken to screen a confined prisoner is much greater than that of, say, an accident victim whose organs must be procured quickly. Ethically, so long as a prisoner is given the same counseling as non-prison donors, ensuring appropriate consent&mdash;the biggest gripe of ethicists&mdash;any ethical issues are easily resolved.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Is informed consent a real concern regarding prisoner donation?</strong><br />
	The medical community and prison systems are still sore from the 70s, when it became apparent that <a href="http://www.prisonexp.org/" target="_blank">prisoners were being used for medical experimentation</a>. Even though prisoners were &quot;volunteering,&quot; there was a paid incentive. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important that organ and tissue donation be offered without perks. No parole considerations. No pay. Not even special visitation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>How many lives could be saved using the organs of executed prisoners?</strong><br />
	First off, organs and tissue from the nearly 2 million non&ndash;death row inmates would make the greatest dent by far, but the numbers of lives that could be saved by the executed are not insubstantial or insignificant. There are currently about <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmates-state-and-size-death-row-year" target="_blank">3,100 prisoners on death row</a> in the US. There are about 45 executions per year, with roughly 1,400 executions since lethal injection was first used. Recent surveys have shown that roughly 80 percent of death row inmates would donate after their execution if given the option.</p>
<p>
	With a planned execution, you can maximize the amount of viable transplants and have recipients at the ready for every part&mdash;one heart, one pancreas, two kidneys, two lungs, two liver lobes, and up to 50 other transplantable parts. This could save or, at the very least, severely improve the lives of hundreds of people every year.</p>
<p>
	<strong>What about those who can&#39;t separate your past from your current mission?</strong><br />
	I agree with the &quot;gifts of a bad man bring no good with them&quot; rationale unless that man can give in a way that does nothing to benefit him. A horrible past does not preclude positive acts, like a fight to donate healthy parts. However, I agree that I&#39;m not the best person to tackle this issue. I was torn for years about how loud to shout. I&#39;m a distraction. My presence adds unnecessary questions to the debate, like this one.</p>
<p>
	Worse, it stirs up the pain of those I&#39;ve hurt. I would like nothing more than to quietly donate, even if it means facing my sentence to do so.</p>

<title>Milf Teeth: For Once, We Shouldn&#039;t Laugh at Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/stop-laughing-at-gwyneth-paltrow-chris-martin</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 15:20:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144709/GwynethPaltrowChrisMartinBreakup.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 444px;" /></p>
<p>
	Within minutes of its hitting the internet, the jokes started coming. Had Chris finally found out that Gwyneth wasn&rsquo;t actually British? Had she finally listened to a Coldplay album? Who would get custody of Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z? Then, when it became apparent that Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin had <a href="http://www.goop.com/journal/be/conscious-uncoupling" target="_blank">announced their marriage break-up</a> as a feature on her lifestyle website Goop, describing the process as a &quot;conscious uncoupling,&quot; the real trolling began.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Of course it did. This is an actress who also used Goop to advertise for a private tutor who would work weekends to teach her kids ancient Greek, Japanese, philosophy, tennis, sailing, and chess&mdash;lessons they were being heinously deprived of at their private school. The children were five and seven years old at the time. The husband is the frontman of a band who sells millions of emotionally tweaking records and who was personally <a href="http://www.celebitchy.com/39666/chris_martin_responds_to_bonos_wanker_comment/" target="_blank">described as a &quot;wanker</a>&quot; on live radio. By Bono. Imagine being described as a wanker by Bono. I do not believe I am exaggerating when I say it would be like your dog standing up on its hind legs in your kitchen one day and suddenly laughing at you for being a dog.</p>
<p>
	So not only does &quot;conscious uncoupling&quot; sound pretty funny, especially if you&rsquo;re more familiar with the unconscious kind, when you go out and get so drunk that you can&rsquo;t even remember getting dumped, but Gwyneth had added a 2,000-word essay from two of her gurus on the spiritual aspects of a healthy break-up. People don&rsquo;t usually try to rebrand the entire concept of divorce while announcing that they&rsquo;re having one, but then Gwyneth is, as my friend Bim put it, a total gangster. The thing about everything these gurus say about conscious uncoupling, though, is that it is true.</p>
<p>
	OK, so this Goop essay contains some unanticipated real talk about insects and their exoskeletons versus the endoskeletons of us vertebrates (and how there was a time, millions of years ago, when a dragonfly&rsquo;s wing measured three feet across, leading to a Russian theory about the creation of insects being a failed attempt by nature to evolve a higher form of consciousness). But more important than the arthropodology is the sense that these are two very famous people who had two very human children and are trying very hard to find a way to still be a family, to let the crack down the middle of them feel like more of a seam.</p>
<p>
	The idea of failed marriage, as theirs will now be described, is so old and rotten that I think I prefer these brave new words of &quot;conscious uncoupling.&quot; What&rsquo;s a failure about more than ten years and two new human beings, raised in love? We&#39;ve got to get over this idea that only &quot;forever&quot; counts. People used to die at 47, and now that&#39;s when they remarry. The life cycle has changed, as Gwyneth&#39;s cheery newsletter points out.</p>
<p>
	People don&rsquo;t fail&mdash;machines fail. Marriage is not a machine; there is no success, there is no failure. Was Leonard and Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s marriage a failure? She preferred women, and they didn&rsquo;t have children, or sexual intercourse. One day she wrote him a note, filled her pockets with stones, and threw herself in the river. Yet the letters they wrote each other, over the years, are among the tenderest things I&rsquo;ve read. &ldquo;You have given me the greatest possible happiness. I don&#39;t think two people could have been happier than we have been,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/02/i-cant-fight-any-longer.html" target="_blank">she said to him</a>, and that&rsquo;s just in her suicide note.</p>
<p>
	Life is like a big bag of raw meat, by the end dripping with piss and blood, ill-defined pauses, and a cinema reel of moments lost and moments gained. I can see why people are laughing at Goop. Positive thinking is a truly helpful tool in so much of life, but sometimes, just sometimes, you want the perfect blond movie star to stand back and say, <em>This is the pits. My feelings are smashed across the floor like a broken bottle of cooking oil</em>. <em>The future is gray. My brain aches. I&rsquo;m through.</em></p>
<p>
	And yet, personally speaking, conscious uncoupling sounds a hell of a lot better than what I&rsquo;ve managed in my own life. Falling out with the person with whom you created children is a heartbreak that I can&rsquo;t even describe. You can&rsquo;t drink it away or find someone else so that it doesn&rsquo;t matter anymore. It will <em>always</em> matter. It&rsquo;s a feeling you wouldn&rsquo;t wish on your worst enemy, although you don&rsquo;t even have to, because the person you loved has already slipped into that role. Your very own angry ghost.</p>
<p>
	So if those cheery blond quinoa-munching celebrities Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin can consciously uncouple, and teach the rest of us how to do it, then please go ahead. I for one will listen. The angry silences can burn a hole in your heart otherwise.</p>

<title>Sex, Snow, and Cocaine: My Life As a Ski Resort &#039;Chalet Bitch&#039;</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/belle-de-neige-ski-underbelly</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 10:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144386/25150-10150166147915106-4735084-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><a href="http://belledeneige.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">Belle de Neige</a> (&ldquo;Beautiful Snow&rdquo;, if you didn&rsquo;t take French) is a blog about what people who work at ski resorts get up to when they&rsquo;re not fixing snow blades, or delivering apr&egrave;s-ski drinks to Jemima Khan and whoever else goes on ski holidays. The writer just condensed a bunch of her blog posts into a book, so we asked her to condense her book back into a blog post. This is that.</em></p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;ve been blogging about all the unpalatable shit people get up to on ski seasons for five years. And I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;ve covered all the major bases: sex, ill-advised drug consumption, orgies, avalanches, immoral workplace behavior, rich delinquents, Russian prostitutes&mdash;everything you&#39;d expect when you mix young people with high altitudes. So wrapping that all up into one snappy article should be easy, right? All I need to do is reel off a few anecdotes involving undignified sexual encounters as a result of British teens exporting British drinking culture, and I&rsquo;m set.</p>
<p>
	But the problem is that I don&rsquo;t want to start out like that, because perpetuating bullshit myths is boring. And because not everyone behind the scenes of Europe&rsquo;s ski resorts are Harrovian drop-outs or braying packs of Hollister homeboys. In fact, many &ldquo;seasonaires&rdquo;&mdash;the word for people who work ski seaons up in the mountains&mdash;aren&rsquo;t like that at all. Many of those I know are laborers or lost their jobs in the recession.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144548/Screen-Shot-2014-03-26-at-10-28-39.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 420px;" /></p>
<p>
	Ski resorts are often sanctuaries for misfits, mid-life crisis sufferers, and the odd dodgy guy with a big scar down his neck who, you suspect, probably <em>can&rsquo;t</em> go home rather than won&rsquo;t go home. Every one of them, just like me, is either running from something or towards something else. They move to the mountains because they&rsquo;d rather live an existence that revolves around adrenaline and fresh morning powder than PS3 marathons and the kind of anonymous powders you buy off 30-year-old losers in parking lots.</p>
<p>
	Of course, it&rsquo;s true that there are also plenty of gap-year vagrants who make ski seasons feel like a succession of back-to-back freshman orientation weeks&mdash;overexcited, rudderless 19-year-olds rolling out of school and rocking up in the Alps without a clue what they&rsquo;re going to be doing for the next six months. Unable to clearly differentiate an ass from an elbow&mdash;let alone do an effective job of catering for holidaymakers&mdash;they spend the majority of their time doing stuff like drinking each other&rsquo;s piss or jumping off roofs into snow drifts after 30 shots of J&auml;germeister.</p>
<p>
	Occasionally, events involving this sort of seasonaire start to take on a sinister edge. One girl I worked with got herself into a very nasty fix after she was filmed blowing a trio of guys (all in costumes) after the Christmas party. I know this because the video was broadcast by one of the perpetrators on a TV in a bar later that week. Of course, it was consensual and she only had herself to blame, but I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling that it looked a bit like borderline gang rape. And who exactly, I wondered, was supposed to be looking out for her?</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144392/189755-674364607790-2196623-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	Stories like this fit the grand tradition of seasonaire life. For instance, there was another girl a few years before our Christmas party, Belladonna, whom staff had nicknamed &ldquo;Harriet the Chariot.&rdquo; She was a talented swimmer who&rsquo;d once been groomed for Olympic duty, but had managed to escape her pushy mother and went off to work a season in a bar. By the end of her time there, she had slept with a total of 200 people, which&mdash;if I&rsquo;ve got my math right&mdash;means she must have been having sex with roughly two different guys a day.</p>
<p>
	My own foray into the alpine abyss was triggered by a particularly hostile breakup, involving an engagement ring, a defaulted mortgage, and a gracious sprinkling of bankruptcy. I&rsquo;d also only just got over the untimely death of my mother, who dropped dead suddenly from a heart attack when I was 21, and then my best friend bit it from a drug overdose.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s fair to say that I didn&rsquo;t exactly touch down for my first season in the most self-possessed state of mind.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144393/162929-584235632182-5428689-n.jpg" style="width: 476px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	Conveniently enough, though, it turned out that a ski resort is the ideal location to get over all these issues&mdash;mostly by getting fucked in every sense of the word. For a while, I went on a one-woman rampage, spending most of my days either up to my armpits in soap-suds and other people&rsquo;s pubic hair, having sex with stoned, broke teenagers on Tabasco-soaked mattresses, or careening down a mountain, fucked up on tranquilizers I&rsquo;d pinched from one of my chalet guest&rsquo;s bathroom cabinets.</p>
<p>
	This quickly descended into an amoral frenzy of bad behavior, which featured me cleaning toilets with my chalet guests&rsquo; toothbrushes, putting poop in their food as revenge for their rudeness, sinking vodka shots for breakfast, or doing a bunch of coke and driving seven-hour airport transfers.</p>
<p>
	In fact, more alarming episodes probably happened to me and those around me in that one season than throughout the rest of my life. I got buried up to my tits in snow after a roof slide, got pissed on by a paralytic French ski instructor, and nailed his friend off-piste in full view of a busy chair lift.</p>
<p>
	I gave numerous blow jobs in toilets and, on one occasion, woke up caked in my own vomit, naked in bed with a man I barely knew, and found a large piece of pink chewing gum stuck between my ass cheeks. Then there was the time I had a threesome in a $15,000-a-week chalet, reamed over an ottoman in nothing but ski boots and a beanie.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144388/487587-10151423825219539-1785085137-n-620x465.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
	I should probably tell you about our guests. For a start, there was the vodka-saturated Ukrainian who let himself into the wrong chalet at four in the morning and got into bed with my guests&rsquo; eight-year-old son. This did not go down well&mdash;there was a lot of gnashing of teeth and screaming about pedophiles. Then there was the bachelor party&mdash;a bunch of guys who turned up with one of their &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; in tow, before offering their host, a wide-eyed 18-year-old girl from Devon, a line out of their huge bag of blow.</p>
<p>
	And, of course, there were the Latvian guests who turned up to my friend&rsquo;s chalet with a couple of six-foot-tall, leather-clad prostitutes, looking like something out of a mid-90s pay-per-view. They had soon littered the entire building with condoms, leaving blood stains and cocaine all over the leather sofas and fucking in the sauna in full view of my friend. But he wasn&rsquo;t complaining, particularly after they started having breakfast topless, or when he was gruffly offered one of the girls as an end-of-week tip.</p>
<p>
	So take from that what you will. But if you&rsquo;re looking for chronic thrush and the opportunity to rub your genitals against an assortment of unwashed people in weird locations (bubble lifts, parked cars in busy town centers, store cupboards, bar toilets, overpopulated bunk rooms), or hoping to break various appendages in the pursuit of enjoying yourself, a ski season is 100-percent the best way to do so.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144390/Oscar.jpg" style="width: 318px; height: 382px;" /></p>
<p>
	I have, of course, somewhat trounced my own point here. Instead of all this crassness, I could have talked about how ski seasons saved me from certain depression. That processing all my woes against a backdrop of soaring, inhospitable terrain taught me a lot about the minuteness of my problems and the corresponding insignificance of humanity as whole. Or that it introduced me to some of the most honest, motivated, and talented people I&#39;ve ever met.</p>
<p>
	But people don&rsquo;t want to hear about that. So I guess it&rsquo;s just much easier to accept the hackneyed, clich&eacute;d image of snowboarding and skiing as a club exclusively for twats&mdash;the preserve of bearded rich kids who say &ldquo;gnarly&rdquo; and &quot;far out&quot; a lot, and have trust funds and yacht club memberships.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144391/253985-10151332393565782-2055191344-n.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
	Snow sports are adored by those who do, and dismissed by those who don&rsquo;t. Because the problem with skiing and snowboarding is that it&rsquo;s hard. You can&rsquo;t pay to be good at it; you have to earn it. Which actually makes it a great leveler. Believe me&mdash;I&rsquo;ve watched plenty of petulant, knock-kneed super-wives fail at the parallel turn to know it to be true. Thousands of bucks in private ski tuition and a shiny Moncler ski jacket do not a skier make.</p>
<p>
	So, as an ode to the experience, I wrote a book about it all. And some of the sex, drugs, and vomit stuff made it in there, too. But much to my disgust, it seems that at this point the publishing industry would much rather scope around for the next slab of saccharine chick-lit to sell to virgins than consider what I have to offer. They don&rsquo;t want vomit and VD&mdash;they want <em>P.S. I Love You</em> set in a snowstorm.</p>
<p>
	But my book has a bit about skiing on ketamine, for fuck&rsquo;s sake. What else should adolescent girls be reading about?</p>
<p>
	<em>You can read more of Belle&rsquo;s tales of &quot;catastrophe, sex, and squalor from the alpine underbelly&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://belledeneige.blogspot.co.uk/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>

<title>&#039;Porn Studies&#039; Is a Serious Academic Journal for Serious Academics</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144690/SexyTeacher.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 321px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Screencap via YouTube uploader <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGOSs0BBWdo" target="_blank">sameesha1000</a></span></em></p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rprn20/current#.UzD5PmRdU4P" target="_blank"><em>Porn Studies</em></a>, the &quot;first dedicated, international, peer-reviewed journal to critically explore those cultural products and services designated as pornographic,&quot; launched on Friday, and it&#39;s currently free. For a limited time, non-academics like you and me can peruse it and try to wrap our quivering brains around some hot, throbbing knowledge before a paywall gets draped over all the best parts.</p>
<p>
	The time was evidently right for the study of porn to take another step toward recognition as an academic field, with not just a journal but also a <a href="http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.cmstudies.org/resource/resmgr/2014_conference/scms2014_onlineprogram.pdf">workshop</a>&nbsp;called &quot;the Pedagogy of Pornography&quot; slated for the Society for Film and Media Studies&#39; 2014 conference in Seattle. Such conferences don&#39;t exactly attract media attention, and so there was no public titillation when the giants of porn studies got together for an all-star show. I contacted them to find out how it went.</p>
<p>
	But first, check out all the action at the journal&#39;s <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rprn20/current#.UzD5PmRdU4P" target="_blank">website</a>. You&nbsp;can get unfettered access, not just to thumbnails but to <em>full-length </em>essays with titles like &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2013.859465#.UzD6GGRdU4M">Humanities and Social Scientific Research Methods in Porn Studies</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.882646#.UzD6H2RdU4M" target="_blank">Positionality and Pornography</a>,&quot; &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzD6c2RdU4M" target="_blank">Authenticity and Its Role Within Feminist Pornography</a>,&quot; and my personal fave, &quot;<a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzD6c2RdU4M">Deep Tags: Toward a Quantitative Analysis of Online Pornography</a>.&quot; And if you prefer your quantitative analysis completely raw-dog, here&#39;s a link to a spreadsheet of the <a href="http://pornstudies.sexualitics.org/data/xhamster.json.tar.gz" target="_blank">entire dataset</a> from the study. Kinda freaky, but, ya know, some people are into that shit.</p>
<p>
	The journal itself is published by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_%26_Francis" target="_blank">Taylor &amp; Francis</a>, a 200-year-old British publishing company that lends gravitas to any such title, and it is perhaps this fact that attracted anti-porn activists to take notice and get their hackles up. After all, even though the journal is a compendium of MLA-formatted essays with proper parenthetical citations, and even though it&#39;s intended for consumption more or less exclusively by tweedy academics, there&#39;s international controversy afoot.</p>
<p>
	I guess that shouldn&#39;t really surprise me, because, after all, the journal discusses videos of naked people fucking.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144453/Screenshot-2014-03-25-10-03-46.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 369px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Gail Dines, screencapped from Youtube user&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ8yrS-fFh0">PublicChristianity</a></i></p>
<p>
	You see, there&#39;s a debate about the ethics of pornography that goes beyond famous battles such as <em>The People vs. Larry Flynt</em>, and <em>Mom vs. 17-Year-Old Son</em>, and when a publication like the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/porn-studies-journal-publishes-its-first-issue-9209885.html" target="_blank">Independent</a></em> in the UK writes about it, that&#39;s their angle. Publications looking for someone to at least sound eloquent and rational tend to look no further than Gail Dines, who also pens <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/stop-porn-culture-those-who-watch-modern-porn-are-becoming-increasingly-desensitised-9195395.html">editorials</a> for the<em>&nbsp;Independent. </em>Their article gives her a platform to say things like &quot;These editors come from a pro-porn background,&quot; implying that a more objective journal would take a very explicitly &quot;anti-porn&quot; approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Dines began as a feminist, and I suppose she remains one to this day, but in the 1970s and 80s&nbsp;there was a schism over how to regard sex in a world informed by feminism. During this era, called&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Sex_Wars">The Sex Wars</a>, many feminist friendships and professional associations ended. Dines formed a makeshift coalition with the religious right, and to this day, she writes books and gives interviews about how harmful porn is. Let it not be said that Dines&#39; writing never includes hard numbers and facts. In a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/11/11/does-pornography-deserve-its-bad-rap/a-pornography-habit-destroys-relationships?pagewanted=all&amp;gwh=1D6A5CFB2DE848CAC811CB2FED18E66C&amp;gwt=regi"><em>New York Times</em> op-ed from 2012</a>,&nbsp;she wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		The most extensive peer-reviewed study in the past decade found that a majority of scenes from 50 top-rented porn movies contained physical and verbal abuse of female performers. Physical aggression&mdash;including spanking, open-hand slapping, and gagging&mdash;occurred in 88 percent of scenes, with expressions of verbal aggression&mdash;usually a man calling a woman derogatory names&mdash;in 48 percent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	No one who brings numbers to a debate can be wrong, right? I think we can all agree that, indeed, the lion&#39;s share of cisgendered, hetero porn lacks situations in which sensitive men focus on pleasing women. Porn is often a garish form of nightmare theater that repeatedly plays out the phallocentric fantasies of society&#39;s lowest common denominator. To put it another way, in porn:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		[...] Young women with crisp fake tans, long platinum blonde hair extensions, silicon breasts, and acrylic nails are fucking cocks that are artificially erect. They vocalize a performative sense of pleasure with moans and squeals as their male counterparts lead them through a formulaic equation of sexual positions that &lsquo;opens&rsquo; the penetrative action up to the camera for the viewer&#39;s pleasure&mdash;not their own. This assemblage of &lsquo;fast food&rsquo; pornographic sex continues until the female performer is instructed to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; an orgasm and receive a load of hot cum on her face.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	Any idea where I got that pull quote? From a <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23268743.2014.888250#.UzHNImRdU4N" target="_blank">paper</a> in&nbsp;<em>Porn Studies</em>, the very publication Dines staunchly opposes.</p>
<p>
	Dine&#39;s censorship rhetoric, as in her editorial, &quot;<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/stop-porn-culture-those-who-watch-modern-porn-are-becoming-increasingly-desensitised-9195395.html">Stop Porn Culture</a>,&quot; allows for a publication called <em>Porn Studies</em>&nbsp;only if what&#39;s being studied is how to abolish it. However, with porn being consumed by approximately everyone, and there being, according to some estimates, as much as one entire internet of porn in existence, advocating for abolition doesn&#39;t seem as helpful as the apparent mission intuited by the editors, contributors, and readers of&nbsp;<em>Porn Studies</em>:&nbsp;to include pornography as a facet of what academics call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies" target="_blank">cultural studies</a>.</p>
<p>
	John Stadler, literature graduate student at Duke University, and one of the figures at the forefront of porn studies, explained this to me more fully in an email. &quot;Porn is a part of culture, and whether one likes it or not, it has and will continue to be a part of our culture throughout our lifetimes. It behooves us as a society to critically engage it without a predetermined agenda.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Because of the whole &quot;without a predetermined agenda&quot; notion, he actually seemed hesitant to weigh in about anti-porn advocacy, since this kind of advocacy is just not part of his job description. When academia is working right (and admittedly it isn&#39;t always), people who have something interesting to say about an issue rise to prominence, and people who just have an ax to grind for one reason or another are relegated to TV talk shows and <em>New York Times</em> editorials.</p>
<p>
	For more on this aspect, I also got in touch with Dr. Constance Penley, one of the leaders in the field of porn studies, to get her take on the reaction to this new field. Penley is a professor of film and media studies at UC Santa Barbara, and one of the first people who ever studied cultural phenomena like fan fiction in an academic setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144451/Screenshot-2014-03-25-10-01-42.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
	<i style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102); font-size: 11px;">Constance Penley, screencapped from the <a href="http://videos.huffingtonpost.com/women/feminist-constance-penley-on-obscenity-and-john-stagliano-326484497" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>
	She told me that the publication of <em>Porn Studies</em> is just the tip of the iceberg for the field. &quot;2013 was the trifecta for porn studies,&quot; she said. In addition to the journal, there were other events she considered milestones like &quot;the release of <em><a href="http://thefeministpornbook.com/,">The Feminist Porn Book</a></em>, and the first annual Feminist Porn Conference.&quot; So while Gail Dines is being <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterNolan1109/status/448139433607307264" target="_blank">targeted</a> by men&#39;s rights advocates as the man-hater who wants to ruin everyone&#39;s fun, she clearly does not have the market cornered on feminism in pornography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Penley told me anti-porn advocates are hardly a blip on the intellectual radar of those in the field, saying, &quot;There isn&#39;t a pro- v. anti-porn argument among scholars but a protest of porn scholarship by anti-porn activists, some of whom try to pass for scholars, who don&#39;t like the scholarly literature&#39;s conclusions,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>
	In other words, <em>Porn Studies</em> will be &quot;pro-porn&quot; when an author has a positive takeaway, &quot;anti-porn&quot; when he or she doesn&#39;t, and probably, more often than not, ambivalent about porn as a whole. This means rather than a rehash of a debate from the old Sex Wars days, the debate can take place in print, every quarter, and it will be peer-reviewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Penley says the problem with advocates like Dines is that they help perpetuate a somewhat stifling culture within academia. &quot;Nearly 70 percent of the professorate is contingent, adjunct labor without the protection of academic freedom to do teaching and research on whatever the professor deems worthy and necessary. Adjunct faculty can&#39;t risk doing anything new, edgy, or nontraditional, anything that would raise controversy. This is a problem not just for porn studies, of course, but for all of humanities and social science scholarship.&quot;</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s hard for non-tenured faculty, whose jobs are not secure, to study anything controversial, because they might be fired when the media picks it up and makes it into something tabloid-worthy. Academia increasingly can&#39;t stand up to the power of bad PR. Donors are extremely susceptible to PR, and it&#39;s easier for a university to just ditch the faculty members causing controversy than to hire a decent branding firm in order to defend their scholarship, even when the scholarship is important and shouldn&#39;t have to be defended.</p>
<p>
	So what will the scholarship consist of? According to Stadler, it will consist, at least in part, of finding hidden complexity. &quot;Porn is often treated as though it were not complex,&quot; he says. &quot;The body has always been a site that has had to struggle to prove its relation to knowledge. That misunderstanding is one that deserves correction.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The body&#39;s &quot;relation to knowledge?&quot; If you can parse material written in academic-ese, there&#39;s about to be some heavy shit written about porn. Personally, I just hope I can keep up.</p>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144686/molly-crabapple-cecily-mcmillian.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 525px; " /></p>
<p>
	<span class="photo_caption">Illustration by Molly Crabapple</span></p>
<p>
	Last week, I sketched an evidentiary hearing for a woman named Cecily McMillan.</p>
<p>
	Two years ago, I&#39;d seen Cecily convulse in handcuffs as the police shut down an <a href="https://news.vice.com/articles/the-case-that-could-rock-the-occupy-movement" target="_blank">Occupy Wall Street</a> protest. Cecily was an organizer. A plain-clothes cop had grabbed her breast from behind, hard enough to leave a bruise shaped like his handprint. Instinctively, she elbowed him. Most women would do the same if a man grabbed them from behind.</p>
<p>
	The cops beat Cecily till they broke her ribs. As she had a seizure on the pavement, the crowd screamed for the police to call 911. The police just watched.</p>
<p>
	Two years later, Cecily is charged with assaulting an officer. She faces seven years in prison.</p>
<p>
	In that fake-wood courtroom in lower Manhattan, the judge told Cecily&#39;s lawyer the fact that her arresting officer had beaten up other people was not relevant to her case. His records would be sealed. Afterward, addressing her supporters, Cecily tried to hide the tremor in her voice.</p>
<p>
	Courtrooms are a violent theater. The violence happens off-scene: in Rikers Island where a homeless man recently <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/american-jails-are-wretched-hell-holes-for-the-mentally-ill">baked to death</a>; in the shackles and beatings and the years far from everything you love. But the courtroom itself is the performative space, the stage where the best story triumphs, and where all parties, except (usually) the defendant, are just playing parts.</p>
<p>
	In the past three years, I&#39;ve sketched many courtrooms. I sat in Fort Meade drawing the back of Chelsea Manning&#39;s cropped blonde hair. In <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/it-dont-gitmo-better-than-this-0001000-v20n8">Guant&aacute;namo Bay</a>, I drew <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/molly-crabapple-sent-us-sketches-from-khalid-sheikh-mohammeds-trial-at-gitmo">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a> through layers of bulletproof glass. I&#39;ve been to hacker trials and misdemeanor court and the sentencings of friends&mdash;though at my lone disorderly conduct hearing, I got an ACD (which is short for adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so fast I couldn&#39;t even reach for my sketchpad.</p>
<p>
	The trials I&#39;ve drawn have mostly been politically motivated. The defendants, however victimized, were also heroes of their stories. They read statements they agonized over, knowing that it might be a long time before they could speak again. The courts tried to stamp out all that was special, to make them fit into what activist Mariame Kaba of Project NIA calls the &ldquo;widget factory&rdquo; that is the criminal justice system. Their supporters tried to tear through the ritual, to remind them they were important and loved.</p>
<p>
	At <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-torture-of-bradley-manning">Chelsea Manning</a>&#39;s trial, her supporters wore shirts reading &ldquo;Truth.&rdquo; Chelsea was not allowed to turn around to see.</p>
<p>
	But the average defendant isn&#39;t a famous whistleblower. He&#39;s a person of color charged with a drug crime. Most trials resemble not grand dramas but factory farms. The raw material is a person. The product is a prisoner. Trials are deliberately dull. They move glacially, on state time rather than human time. If you hire your own lawyers&mdash;a necessity to have a chance of winning&mdash;you&#39;ll blow through your life savings. As the cop clich&eacute; goes, &ldquo;You can beat the rap, but you can&#39;t beat the ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Yet America loves her trials. Courtrooms are secular churches. Bow your head, hush your voice. With enough <em>Law and Order</em> episodes, the criminal justice system gets mixed up with justice. Square-jawed prosecutors will punish the wicked. The innocent will be redeemed.</p>
<p>
	Real trials like acquitted baby killer Casey Anthony&#39;s are layered over fictional ones. They&#39;re outlets for collective sadism. Look at the murderess. Are we not pure?</p>
<p>
	The pop culture courtroom is familiar to all Americans. It is both grand and comforting, a pillar of our democracy. So we ignore the reality that we imprison more of our population than any country in the world, in horrific conditions, half of them for drugs, disproportionately the poor and brown.</p>
<p>
	If &ldquo;getting your day in court&rdquo; means justice, why should you complain if you&#39;re locked in a box when that day is done?</p>
<p>
	No one who&#39;s spent time in courts believes trials are about truth.</p>
<p>
	A former prosecutor I spoke to told me he&#39;d been trained to conduct a trial like a performance. It was all about keeping the audience engaged. He would point at the defendant, stabbing the air with his finger, to show the jury that they too should point at him with a guilty verdict. The prosecutor told me that there was no feeling worse than hearing &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo; It was 12 average Americans saying he sucked at his job.</p>
<p>
	Defense attorneys I spoke with agreed. It&#39;s all about the story&mdash;something that public defenders, who get paid nil and don&#39;t have the power of the state behind them, are usually too overburdened to craft.</p>
<p>
	At sentencing, performance and pragmatism coalesce into poison. At the sentencing hearing, the prosecutor will always paint the defendant as a threat to all good citizens snug in their beds. To keep them safe, the defendant must get as many years as possible. But weeks before trial began, that same prosecutor will usually have offered the defendant a plea deal that was a fraction of that sentence.</p>
<p>
	Because the entire system would implode if everyone demanded a trial, prosecutors push plea bargains like restaurants hawking early bird specials. But instead of money, they&#39;re haggling over life. If you&#39;re too poor for a lawyer or have already spent months in jail because you can&#39;t make bail, plea bargains can be irresistible. They account for 95 percent of felony convictions.</p>
<p>
	Marissa Alexander, a PhD and mom who fired a warning shot at the ceiling to stop her husband from beating her, was offered three years as a plea deal for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. She refused, knowing herself innocent. The judge sentenced her to 20 years. Now, she&#39;s appealing. If she loses, the prosecutor wants to lock her up for 60.</p>
<p>
	This is a &ldquo;trial tax&rdquo; you pay if you annoy the courts by insisting you are innocent.</p>
<p>
	At trial, you better fit a casting agent&#39;s idea of &ldquo;Not Guilty.&rdquo; Cecily McMillan is small, white, and lovely in her blowout and blazer. White America seldom imagines that little white girls, like Cecily and me, will punch cops. We wear the costume of innocence. It&rsquo;s not surefire, but it helps.</p>
<p>
	The poor, the brown, the trans&mdash;to juries, they&#39;re guilty unless proven otherwise. Innocence is the absence of guilt. It is near impossible to prove a negative.</p>
<p>
	If you&#39;re too poor to afford bail, you arrive in court in chains. If you have no family to bring you a suit, you wear your prison jumpsuit. During her murder trial, Angela Davis&#39;s team fought for her to get bail. They wanted her to go into the courtroom each day in her own clothes, looking like a woman who was and would be free.</p>
<p>
	When I write about courts, there&#39;s pressure to add <em>of course</em>.&nbsp;<em>Of course</em> some defendants are guilty.&nbsp;<em>Of course</em> there are rapists and murderers. <em>Of course</em> judges and prosecutors see themselves as good people doing a tough job, trying to get through the day. Yet this <em>of course</em> excuses too much. It excuses a system drenched with racism, corruption, and violence. It excuses a contest where he with the most cash wins. Where instead of truth, justice or mercy, lawyers must craft fables&mdash;tales rigged in favor of those who already have the most.</p>
<p>
	As I sat at Cecily&#39;s trial, my friends were in Philly, attending hacker <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/lulz-and-leg-irons-in-the-courtroom-with-weev">Andrew &ldquo;weev&rdquo; Auernheimer</a>&#39;s appeal. Auernheimer himself was in solitary, locked with his thoughts in a six-foot-by-11-foot box.</p>
<p>
	Last March, I attended Auernheimer&#39;s sentencing. Hacker Jaime Cochran had taken the train 20 hours from Chicago to support him. She was thrown out of the courtroom for touching her phone. Jaime stood on the other side of the door. Every time it opened, she screamed &ldquo;Dongs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Afterwards, some criticized Jaime for not respecting the court. But from where I sat, it felt like the most human thing anyone could have done.</p>
<p>
	The court was locking up Jaime&#39;s friend. She couldn&#39;t stop that. At least she could show that she wasn&#39;t buying their show. Jaime told me later that she refused to be a &ldquo;docile spectator&rdquo; in her friend&#39;s life.</p>
<p>
	After one trial, the lawyers move on to another. Judges hear the next case. But for most defendants, courtrooms are preludes to cages. After the theater of justice, reality is theirs alone.</p>

<title>The Death of a Romanian Kangaroo</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/the-death-of-a-romanian-kangaroo-0000264-v21n3</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/front-of-the-book/kangaroo.jpg" style="width: 634px; height: 831px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
	It sounds like the start of a heartstring-tugging kids&rsquo; film: On January 14, in the western Romanian city of Arad, the cops received a series of calls reporting that children were chasing a kangaroo down by the railroad tracks. At first they assumed it was a joke, but later they were called by the railroad police, who said, essentially, no, it was a real animal, and yes, they had it in custody. When the cops arrived to pick the kangaroo up, it had already died, of stress or suffocation, in the trunk of a railroad policeman&rsquo;s car, which is where this story ceases to be anything resembling a movie for kids.</p>
<p>
	Nobody has assumed responsibility for the death of the kangaroo. The local police told me that the situation is the responsibility of the railroad police in Arad, because it was their trunk in which the kangaroo had died. But the railroad police in Arad told me that it was the job of the railroad officers at the Aradul Nou station, since they were the ones who had caught the animal. The Aradul Nou station cops said I should talk to the local police. After I told them that I already called the local police, they simply said, &ldquo;Then we can&rsquo;t help you. Have a nice day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	But never mind whose jurisdiction the kangaroo expired in. The real question is, how the heck did it show up in Arad in the first place? Livia Cimpoeru, a spokeswoman for Vier Pfoten, an animal rights organization that had complained to the local police about the kangaroo, said that the bouncy marsupials had become a recent hot item for exotic-animal dealers and collectors.</p>
<p>
	&rdquo;More and more kangaroos show up in Romania, like we&rsquo;re turning into Australia,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Last year, I personally followed a driver who was transporting a kangaroo. Another kangaroo was seen at the border with Hungary. Two other kangaroos were attacked and eaten by stray dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This past year has seen many cases of animal trafficking in Romania&mdash;in one memorable incident, an entire illegal zoo that included four lions and two bears was found in the backyard of a mafia boss. It&rsquo;s illegal for ordinary people to sell kangaroos, or any other wild beasts, but the laws surrounding trafficking animals are vague&mdash;the penalty is likely to be, at most, a year in prison and a 400-euro [$550] fine for animal cruelty. At those prices, who can afford <em>not</em> to hawk a few kangas for spare cash?</p>
<p>
	The issue, Livia told me, is that the Romanian authorities don&rsquo;t seem to care about the illegal animal trade. &ldquo;Romania is a transit country for an extraordinary animal-trafficking ring that goes through Hungary,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The border police aren&rsquo;t doing their jobs, and the local police are just shrugging their shoulders. They know that they&rsquo;d have to confiscate the animal, but they don&rsquo;t know what to do with it&mdash;they&rsquo;d have to call the mayor&rsquo;s office, the local zoo, and veterinarians. So they just say, &lsquo;Screw it; we have more important things to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<title>The LAPD Is Arresting Venice Hippies for Having Drum Circles</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/venice-beach-is-safe-for-now-thanks-to-eagle-soaring-chief</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144497/ChiefEagleWide.jpg" style="width: 650px; height: 435px;" /></p>
<p>
	For Los Angeles locals, Venice has always been a both cheery and dirty daycation spot. The beach is filled with decades-old locals who are mostly leathery hippies, peacefully maintaining it as their own, plus a permanently homeless population just looking for a grassy spot to get drunk and nap.</p>
<p>
	Ever since the gangs of the 90s were priced out by techies and &quot;creative professionals&quot; creeping in from neighboring white-bread Santa Monica and yacht-bred Marina del Ray, there&rsquo;s been a calm, commercial peace with the police, allowing the street vendors to hawk their handmade wares.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144501/BeachCrowd.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the anything-goes, free-love vibe also attracts drug addicts and loud party boys looking to get fucked up, with no regard for cleanliness or spiritual enlightenment via drumming.</p>
<p>
	In 2012, I briefly lived in a coke dealer&rsquo;s unfinished house off the beach, so I knew the background police presence was nothing new, but new <a href="http://venice311.org/venice-boardwalk/boardwalk-vending-rules-information/lamc-42-15-boardwalk-ordinance/" target="_blank">ordinances on vending and excessive noise</a> have ended in a series of violent altercation between cops and locals at the infamous weekend drum circle. The most recent was on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-two-arrested-venice-beach-drum-circle-police-20140317,0,7832871.story" target="_blank">Sunday</a>, so I drove down to see what had changed.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144500/PoliceCruisersBeach.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	When I arrived, at 4:20 PM, the drumming was just picking up. Concentric circles of decreasing levels of involvement defined their participants. The final circle consisted of vulture-like SUVs in slow orbit around the celebration, picking off those drinking from glass bottles or sucking down blunts in plain sight.</p>
<p>
	I approached an officer idling in his car some 20 feet from the edge of the drum circle. He seemed more than willing to talk&mdash;friendly even&mdash;behind menacing wraparound shades while his partners prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144502/BeachArrest2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	I asked him if they expected a bigger police presence than normal: &ldquo;Oh, yeah,&rdquo; Officer Mark said. &ldquo;Last week, people got drunk and high and started throwing bottles at us when we shut down the drum circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The relatively recent noise ordinance allows the LAPD to stop the drumming, but in doing so it effectively pushes the crowd off the beach, despite their right to stay until midnight, sans &ldquo;excessive noise.&quot; Mark continued, &ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;re not allowed to smoke weed or drink alcohol, and you&rsquo;re definitely not allowed to throw glass at police officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144511/PoliceObservationBeach.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Something crackled over the radio, and Mark excused himself before gunning it toward the boardwalk. Three more SUVs whipped past me with their lights blaring, and some ten officers piled out to descend on a potentially homeless guy and his unleashed dog. Clearly, he was a local.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144499/BeachArrest.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	While two cops put him in handcuffs, the rest milled around. An artist building the Sphinx out of sand on the sidewalk told me it was just a couple dudes in an argument, nothing serious. Fights on Venice Beach are a regular occurrence, but the flurry of police out of seemingly nowhere felt new.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144509/SleepingPersonBeach.jpg" style="width: 428px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	The latest ordinances&mdash;and the increased police force&mdash;were bolstered by a wealthy community looking to preserve the cultural epicenter they&rsquo;d paid through the nose to live in, missing the point that the original community existed solely because of a lack of such ordinances. Hippies, performance artists, street vendors, and that guy on roller skates playing Hendrix see curfews and permits as antithetical to their very existence.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144503/ChiefBadge.jpg" style="width: 428px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
	The previous lack of a police presence hinged on the cooperation of Venice&rsquo;s residents, the ringleader of which appeared to be an older orange-ish gentleman with long white hair and a matching beard. He was standing on an upturned metal barrel waving a &ldquo;Peace to All Nations&rdquo; flag, dancing and occasionally fist-bumping with similarly tanned locals.</p>
<p>
	The 66-year-old &quot;Eagle Soaring Chief&quot; of Venice Beach wore a security officer badge on his tattered, open shirt. He looked like he&rsquo;d been ripening in the sun for the past 12 years.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144504/BeachWide.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	As a self-appointed ambassador to the people, the Chief says he&#39;s earned the right to peacefully regulate &ldquo;his&rdquo; beach, working with the locals to take care of problems the police either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t deal with. &ldquo;If they don&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;ll ban them from the beach. The police can&rsquo;t ban people; I can,&rdquo; the Chief of the Beach told me.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been here for 66 years; [the police] just showed up six days, six minutes ago. I don&rsquo;t blame them, and hey, I don&rsquo;t want alcoholics on this beach either. I don&rsquo;t want drug addicts on this beach. If I catch anybody fighting it&mdash;see my teeth? &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re all knocked out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144505/PoliceBack.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	The Chief explained that the previous week&rsquo;s altercation was the result of three &ldquo;knucklehead&rdquo; drummers nobody knew, and that the police crackdown was in response to three plastic bottles thrown from the boardwalk, not glass.</p>
<p>
	Despite the encroaching presence of the LAPD, many of the locals seemed content with their presence, as it meant fewer drug addicts and troublemakers, although they too seemed oblivious to the effects of increased regulation.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144506/PoliceCars.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	For the next few hours till sundown, the crowd doubled in size, splitting into two interconnected circles. The Chief wandered around, smiling and laughing. Every hour another SUV would pull up to the crowd and empty a few officers onto the sand.</p>
<p>
	With 20 minutes to go, a half dozen officers surrounded the officer in charge, Sergeant Brian Gura. I asked him how many he had prepared, and he gestured toward the boardwalk: &ldquo;Enough. We want to avoid a repeat of last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144508/DSC03204.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before, but lining the boardwalk must have been at least 30 officers ready to grab the incoming crowd if things got ugly. As the sun dipped into the water, the cops on the beach piled into their cars and turned on the Christmas lights, driving slowly and deliberately towards the crowd.</p>
<p>
	The Chief waved toward the drummers and sliced his hand through the air as if to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re done!&rdquo; A few other regulars did the same, and about half the crowd dispersed toward the boardwalk as Sergeant Gura exited his car, flanked by three officers, and made his way toward the still dancing center. He smiled as they cleared out.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144507/PoliceNighttime.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	One guy came up to them filming on his iPhone, demanding an explanation for the intimidating police tactics. Gura replied, &ldquo;I&#39;m not trying to intimidate you. You&#39;re just very short, and I&#39;m very tall; there&#39;s nothing I can do about that.&rdquo; People laughed; order had been restored. A few idiots kept shouting, &ldquo;TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144498/BeachSunset.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 428px;" /></p>
<p>
	Back at the boardwalk, as police began to leave, a few stayed to talk and joke with the regulars. Tensions were gone, and the night was falling. The Chief came up behind me, put his hand on my shoulder, and pointed at the diminishing taillights. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all right now,&rdquo; he said with an air of eternal hope. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mutual.&rdquo;</p>

<title>&#039;New York&#039; - Photos by Neil Winokur</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/new-york-0000257-v21n3</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" border="0" height="785" src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v21n3/htdocs/new-york/can-in-paper-bag.jpg" width="640" /></p>
<p>
	Nobody I talk to under the age of 40 knows the work of Neil Winokur. This seems odd in light of the 68-year-old photographer&rsquo;s achievements: His work has been collected by the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, to name a few. MoMA included him in its important 1991 exhibition <i>Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort</i>. In 1994 the Smithsonian published a monograph of his pictures, titled <i>Everyday Things</i>. By objective standards, he is an important artist. So why does a Google image search of his name retrieve only a narrow selection of the hundreds of photographs Neil has exhibited over the course of his career?</p>
<p>
	I will admit that, until a photography-critic friend mentioned Neil to me a couple of months ago, I had not heard of him either. Why was his work not covered in my college photo-history classes? Most artists with his credentials go on to found cult-like educational institutes or build extravagant palazzos. They do attention-getting things like performing with Lady Gaga or Jay-Z.</p>
<p>
	When I went to visit Neil at the quiet Manhattan apartment where he lives with his wife, their twins, and their two cats, the reasons I hadn&rsquo;t seen him in recent headlines became clear to me. He&rsquo;s not that kind of artist. This is a grounded man who is incredibly dedicated to his family. He has worked as a used-book buyer at New York&rsquo;s Strand bookstore for the past four decades, and so of course his house is filled with books.</p>
<p>
	Neil&rsquo;s work proposes that it is possible to depict a culture through its most ordinary objects. A native New Yorker, he applied this logic to his hometown for the 1999 series <i>New York</i>. He lured the viewer into these starkly graphic tableaux with a color wheel of luminously atmospheric backgrounds, giving each object a great deal of importance. &ldquo;Andy Warhol said that everybody has 15 minutes of fame,&rdquo; Neil told me. &ldquo;I do still lifes because I think these objects should get theirs.&rdquo; These objects are products of our society, so they can be held up as mirrors to it. As Neil puts it, &ldquo;I try to photograph objects that are archetypal, objects that have a meaning to society beyond themselves. An American flag, a glass of water. I did a toilet, and it sold out almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<description><![CDATA[<div>
	<p class="photo_caption">
		<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144492/flickrsuns.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 457px;" /></p>

		<em>541,795 Suns from Sunsets from Flickr (Partial) 1/26/06, 2006, detail of 2000 machine c-prints, each 4inch x 6inch</em> by Penelope Umbrico (courtesy of the artist)</p>
</div>
<div>
	On good days, I assume that reality exists.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	That is, I assume that every perspective in every moment in every location happens whether or not it is experienced, recorded, or photographed&mdash;that the tree fell in the forest, made a sound, etc.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	I think this is partially why I&rsquo;ve always thought of photography as a medium of curation more than creation, of editing more than writing. Actually, legendary MOMA curator John Szarkowski put it way better: &ldquo;One might compare the art of photography to the act of pointing.&rdquo;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Pointing is a reaction to something that&rsquo;s already there. It&rsquo;s the photographer choosing which moments in a finite world are worth keeping, and then choosing which handful of those extractions deserve our attention: the rare second, the third or fourth glance. It&rsquo;s all an artful distillation process&mdash;the ability to take the overwhelming mass of visual data that is this world and mine it for some digestible quantity of highly potent imagery.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>

	So, as the visual complexity and depth of digital worlds begins to rival that of the &ldquo;real&rdquo; one, it only makes sense that some pointing happens there. The visual internet, all its nooks and crannies, sits as a relatively untapped reservoir of imagery ripe for curation, like some sort of duplicate world that has yet to be blanketed by tourists with smartphones.&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>
	<a href="http://www.dougrickard.com/photographs/a-new-american-picture/">Doug Rickard&#39;s</a>&nbsp;<em>New American Picture</em>, a project culled from a year of Google Street View screen grabs, is a great exploration into that Wild, Wild West. I&rsquo;ve seen interviews in which Rickard talks about making the work, and he sounds like a kid who&rsquo;s discovered a new playground. He turned the reality of Street View into a raw collection of 100,000 images, then turned that collection into 10,000 35mm photographs, ultimately selecting 20 of those photographs for an exhibition.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	When I first saw the project, I tried to sniff out some hint of emotional vapidity, as if I could use a sixth sense of sorts to detect that these images were mined from a reality composed of data, of 0s and 1s instead of flesh and bones. But it turned out that all I felt was the raw power of the photographs, each one freighted with an ineffable emotion that&rsquo;s endemic to lots of great photography captured in the real America&mdash;ya know, the one you can actually touch with your fingertips.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Recently, Magnum Photos&rsquo; <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL5359SL">Thomas Dworzak</a> has been curating photos he finds on Instagram. A guy who has covered war for most of his life, Dworzak explores this digital reality using hashtags and search terms where he used to use planes, his legs, and street smarts. The result is a handful of raw chapbooks composed of mostly screenshots that do a great job of visually capturing the zeitgeist surrounding, say, the Boston Marathon Bombing.</div>

<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Maybe my favorite thing about Dworzak&rsquo;s Instagram collections, which he made with no intention to sell, is that they do more than just illustrate how our culture digests current events: They reveal how inextricably bound image making and sharing have become with that very digestion.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This all might sound like more fatiguing art-meets-internet talk, the kind that lots of folks are tired reading about in commentary, tired of seeing at galleries. But I think this fatigue is borne out of some strange new school iconoclastic anxiety that goes against the very nature of the medium.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Rickard and Dworzak&rsquo;s projects, and even those from artists like <a href="http://www.penelopeumbrico.net/">Penelope Umbrico</a> and <a href="http://mediastorm.com/clients/2013-icp-infinity-awards-art-mishka-henner">Mishka Henner</a>, remind me that photography is one of the great coping mechanisms in the face of the world&rsquo;s visual &quot;too&shy;muchness.&quot; It&rsquo;s the presentation of clear frequencies amid a sometimes indiscernible and overwhelming cacophony of noise. As the volume knob gets cranked up&mdash;55 million new images uploaded every day on Instagram, a complete visual mapping of the inhabited earth&mdash;I grow only more thankful for good pointers.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Shit, I think, without them, all that &ldquo;too&shy;muchness&rdquo; would feel like nothing at all.&nbsp;</div>

	<em>Kenny vs. Spenny</em> was a Canadian TV show from the mid aughts that centered around two roommates and their weekly in-house competitions. The episodes ranged from &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRMoHK9XGzk">Who Can Win a Court Case</a>&quot; to &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xKeEtLgCSo">Who Can Be Tied to a Goat the Longest</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwy6afENAYM">Who Can Get Further with the Other Guy&#39;s Mom</a>.&quot; It was the best thing that Canada has ever made. Tragically, the show was canceled in 2010, but Kenny is spearheading a campaign aimed at getting Netflix to renew the series for another season. A few days ago, our Toronto counterparts invited Kenny and Spenny into their office to film a live Reddit AMA session.</p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Turkish Prime Minister&nbsp;Recep Tayyip Erdogan on TV. Photo by Ekin &Ouml;zbi&ccedil;er</em></p>
<p>
	It was 11P M on a Thursday night in Yenik&ouml;y, a neighborhood in the northern part of Istanbul. My wife and I sat in our living room, watching Turkey&#39;s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, address his followers at a pre-election rally in the city of Bursa. The rant was about Twitter. &ldquo;Twitter, shwitter!&rdquo; he yelled at an ecstatic crowd. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to uproot it! I don&rsquo;t care what the international community says. We&rsquo;re dealing with an international conspiracy here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I switched the channel, and there it was again: Erdogan&#39;s face, contorted and angry. Another channel, the same face&mdash;neatly trimmed, Islam-approved mustache bobbing up and down as he continued to shout about the evils of social media, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/20/us-turkey-election-idUSBREA2J1V420140320" target="_blank">threatening</a> to shut down Twitter and other social networking sites.</p>
<p>
	This scapegoating wasn&#39;t anything particularly new, either; it&#39;s just that the target had changed. Previously, he&#39;s blamed an elusive <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204124204577154353478071244" target="_blank">&ldquo;interest rate lobby,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/islamist-turkey-pm-threatens-to-expel-us-ambassador-for-corruption-comments/" target="_blank">the US</a>,<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/12/pro-erdogan-media-says-israel-behind-corruption-probe.html#" target="_blank">Israel</a>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&quot;<a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-erdogan-calls-protesters-atheists-leftists-terrorists.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=63068&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">the atheists</a>,&quot; and even <a href="http://www.todayszaman.com/columnists/gunay-hilal-aygun_339852-what-if-an-uncovered-woman-claimed-she-had-been-attacked.html" target="_blank">topless men dressed in leather</a> for the violence and economic losses that came out of the massive Gezi protests last summer. Now Twitter is the guilty party. &ldquo;Twitter and all [the other social media outlets]&mdash;none of them are bigger than our nation,&quot; he proclaimed. The following day, <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/03/turks-report-widespread-twitter-outages-20143210429682465.html" target="_blank">authorities blocked access to Twitter</a>&mdash;a move that was denounced by President&nbsp;Abdullah G&uuml;l.</p>
<p>
	Given that a leaked wiretap revealing the illicit goings-on of his government has been released in segments on Twitter&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/leaked-tapes-calls-erdogan-resign-turkish-pm" target="_blank">every day</a> for <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/twitter-blocked-in-turkey-amid-sons-of-thieves-leaks.html">the past month</a>, Erdogan&rsquo;s beef with the micro-messaging site isn&#39;t exactly surprising. The government is attributing these leaks to a mysterious&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/24/us-turkey-investigation-idUSBREA1N1EO20140224" target="_blank">&ldquo;parallel state&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;(a former suspect was the <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-pm-accuses-robot-lobby-of-conducting-plot-against-the-govt.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=62928&amp;NewsCatID=338" target="_blank">&quot;robot lobby&quot;</a>), <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116044/fethullah-gulen-turkish-prime-minister-erdogans-biggest-rival" target="_blank">implying that the secretive Fethullah G&uuml;len</a>&mdash;a past ally of Erdogan&#39;s, but now a rival Islamist leader living in exile in Pennsylvania&mdash;is responsible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The leaks started surfacing right after&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0607420140107" target="_blank">some 1,700 police officers</a>&nbsp;were reassigned and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/22/us-turkey-corruption-idUSBREA0L1G220140122" target="_blank">roughly 120</a> judges and prosecutors were implicated in the &quot;<a href="http://www.thenewturkey.org/what-have-we-learned-from-the-december-17-operation/new-turkey/8619" target="_blank">December 17 Operation</a>&quot;&mdash;a criminal investigation into government corruption. A number of high profile personalities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-25475859" target="_blank">(including the sons</a> of some of Erdogan&rsquo;s closest associates) have already been arrested on&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_corruption_scandal_in_Turkey" target="_blank">charges</a> of embezzlement, bribery, smuggling, and international money laundering. Inquiries are ongoing.</p>
<p>
	The source of the leaks are two suggestively named Twitter accounts&mdash;Haramzadeler (&ldquo;Sons of sinners&rdquo;) and Baş &Ccedil;alan (&ldquo;Prime Thief&rdquo;)&mdash;which have outed Erdogan and his closest stooges&rsquo; private conversations. The (unproven) <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/03/erdogan-calls-judiciary-tape.html#" target="_blank">leaks</a> have implied that there are no limits to the prime minister&rsquo;s reach, suggesting he single-handedly micro-managed the fate of controversial real estate development projects and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkKSJxu5NHM " target="_blank">handpicked university deans</a> (a role reserved for the president),<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/world/europe/turkey-corruption-inquiry.html" target="_blank">supreme court judges</a> (a role reserved for the High Commission of Judges and Prosecutors, a supposedly independent body), and even popular <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pSZJJI0wVM" target="_blank">football</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3olqIqOt9E" target="_blank">chairmen</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
	The public believed it to be a case of self-censorship when privately owned national news channels decided to broadcast cooking shows and <a href="http://dmlcentral.net/blog/zeynep-tufekci/pepper-spray-and-penguins-analysis-turkeys-social-media-fueled-gezi-protests" target="_blank">documentaries about penguins</a> during the massive Gezi protests, but it appears that nearly all of those decisions had been down to Erdogan. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ah8DjSXDTE" target="_blank">He reportedly watched every single TV show</a>&mdash;even following the news tickers along the bottom of the screen&mdash;and read every piece of news he could.</p>
<p>
	He allegedly instructed his allies on the editorial boards to interfere with the content he disliked, pulled newscasters off the air, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46IPrTw9RKI " target="_blank">fired voices</a> too critical for his taste. The illicit&mdash;and yet to be verified&mdash;leaks give the impression of a media system where all the main players, thanks to their interest in maintaining government contracts, had been not only complying but actively cooperating with the government and its demands.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144256/20130612--MG-0154-Edit.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Photo by &Ccedil;ağlar Kanzık</em></p>
<p>
	Back to that ordinary Thursday night. A few hours after Erdogan&rsquo;s rant about Twitter, we switched the channel to CNN T&uuml;rk. On screen was the journalist Abdulkadir Selvi, a known government apologist, who was commenting on the speech we&#39;d just watched:</p>
<blockquote>
	[Forces] are trying to redesign Turkey through publishing illegal recordings on this internet [<em>sic</em>]. Unlike how it would play out in the US, UK, or France, the court orders are not fulfilled by Twitter or Facebook. If someone listened to President Obama&rsquo;s private calls illegally and leaked them on Twitter, we know they would be promptly packed away to Guant&aacute;namo. When it comes to Turkey, though, nobody cares about court orders or protection of the private lives of its citizens. They have to come open their offices here and respect the Turkish law&mdash;that&rsquo;s what the PM meant. Otherwise he neither has [the] will nor the power to shut Twitter down, and I would be the first to oppose if he did.</blockquote>
<p>
	It seemed that Selvi was totally oblivious to the events that followed the rise of WikiLeaks and its massive campaign against America&#39;s military and government, in that all <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/01/07/report-us-subpoenas.html" target="_blank">the subpoenas</a>, take-down notices, and identity requests they sent to Twitter admins achieved absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In fact, Erdogan and his co-conspirators are much luckier than their Western counterparts in many ways. As the leaks show, their focus has been largely local or, at most, regional&mdash;an illegal shipment of gold to Iran here, a bribe from Dubai there, a little power mongering and corruption on the side. This stuff is nowhere near as controversial as Edward Snowden&rsquo;s NSA/GCHQ/PRISM leaks, which exposed outrageous misconduct on a global scale.</p>
<p>
	And what happened there? Well, Snowden won&#39;t be going back to Virginia any time soon, but he isn&#39;t exactly locked up in Guant&aacute;namo, either. And despite all the uproar, it seems that operations at the British and American intelligence agencies are continuing as normal.</p>
<p>
	Erdogan and his allies need to understand what their Western counterparts have already grasped&mdash;that without citizens being able to vent through social media, you run the risk of them taking their frustrations to the street. And as the governments of Turkey&rsquo;s surrounding countries saw during the Arab Spring, Molotov cocktails and braying mobs are much better at toppling rulers than angry tweets and Facebook updates.</p>
<p>
	Instead of turning to violence, we spend every day waiting for the next leak, like our parents spent every week waiting for a new episode of <em>Dallas</em>. And like J. R. Ewing, Erdogan has become a baddy of light entertainment&mdash;someone we love to hate, just another player in a society obsessed with spectacle. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That&#39;s why all the leaks in the world ultimately won&#39;t make any difference to Erdogan or his government. Accepting the social media response to a government scandal has the power to prevent legitimate physical action&mdash;it turns the outrage into another storyline within the grand spectacle, morphing Erdogan from a tyrant into a TV villain. Which is exactly why he needs to drop his assault on Twitter, because, in the end, people will naturally lose interest in the drama. Just like Berlusconi, Bush, and Sarkozy, the ratings will drop, and Erdogan will fade away into obscurity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Arab Spring Was Just a Translation Mistake</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/the-arab-spring-was-a-translation-mistake</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 17:59:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144482/Arab-Spring-map-svg.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 349px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 16px;">Image via <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arab_Spring_map.svg">Wikimedia Commons</a></span> </em></p>
<p>
	From the all-out civil war in Syria to the internet restrictions in Turkey and the return of military rule in Egypt, the revolutionary youth of the Arab Spring seem to be facing one hurdle after another. VICE obtained an exclusive copy of a study that concluded that the &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; seems to have been just a &ldquo;translation mistake.&rdquo; Additionally, there is no evidence at all to support the theory that people in the Middle East had revolted against their rulers. The revelations come as an embarrassment to Western media outlets that have been claiming for three years that people from Tunisia to Syria were engaged in popular uprisings, as it becomes apparent that the misperception was a result of a multitude of translation mistakes by reporters and commentators who are not sufficiently versed in Arabic.</p>
<p>
	The study that VICE obtained a copy of prior to publication was conducted by a panel of European and American experts and was funded by the government of Saudi Arabia, but there is nothing to suggest that it had ulterior motives in commissioning the report beyond its commitment to truth and accuracy in reporting. The experts analyzed hundreds of videos and articles and recorded many witness testimonies that all firmly point to a giant misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
	According to the report, Western reporters in Tunisia and Egypt were confused by the scenes of thousands of people on the streets and wrongly assumed that they were protesting against the regimes when in fact they were spontaneously expressing their support for their leaders. Upon reading the reports in the Western press, Tunisia&rsquo;s former president, Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, a sensitive and considerate leader much beloved by his people, felt deeply hurt and decided to leave power before the truth emerged.</p>
<p>
	A similar scenario was repeated in Egypt, when President Hosni Mubarak decided to leave power rather than risk upsetting his people. The report points out to Western support of the two presidents as evidence of their essential goodness, as it is inconceivable that the Western powers would support corrupt dictatorial regimes.</p>
<p>
	A crucial piece of evidence was the mistranslation of the phrase <em>al sha&rsquo;ab yurid ithbat al nizam</em> (the people want the stability of the regime) as <em>al sha&rsquo;ab yurid isqat al nizam</em> (the people want the fall of the regime). The reporters quizzed about this claimed that it was very loud during these demonstrations, and it was an honest mistake than anyone could make.</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, events quickly spiraled out of control before anyone could correct these mistakes, and as the celebrations spread to other Arab countries, the Western press continued to misinterpret them as protests against the rulers. The study harshly criticized lack of familiarity with Arab culture and norms and poor language skills for these failings, which have inadvertently destabilized the region and perhaps the entire world for years to come.</p>
<p>
	A spokesman for the Saudi government outlined the reasons for commissioning the study arguing that the Kingdom has always been interested in promoting cultural understanding and accuracy of reporting, so it decided to use its resources to correct this giant mistake. &ldquo;Arab people have huge respect for their leaders, and protests have no place in our culture. Sadly, foreign reporters misinterpreted these events due to their lack of training in cultural sensitivity and poor grasp of the complex Arab language,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Tragically it seems that the very first public gathering that sparked the theory of an &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; was a surprise birthday party that people in one Tunisian town had planned for their leader and that Western journalists present misinterpreted as a demonstration. The passionate and raucous nature of Arab celebrations was lost on the reporters, who are predisposed to see Arabs as angry mobs. The report recommends further investment by Western governments and media outlets in cultural sensitivity training to overcome those barriers in the future.</p>
<p>
	The Saudi spokesman urged everyone involved to come together to put a line underneath this chapter, citing his government&rsquo;s effort to end the misunderstanding in Egypt and repair the damage done by misguided Western reporting. &ldquo;We are very close to re-establishing the situation exactly as it was in 2010 before all of this started. Please urge your governments to support us in correcting this historical error.&rdquo; He lamented how a small translation mistake caused this much damage, and urged Western reporters to rely on official version of events in the future to avoid such confusion.</p>

<p>
	On Friday, we got two strangers to have an awkward first date in the apartment above our London pub, the Old Blue Last.</p>
<p>
	We livestreamed the date&mdash;which lasted three hours&mdash;on our website. They didn&#39;t fall in love.</p>
<p>
	Tons of people watched, though, so here are the highlights.</p>
<p>
	Look out for more <em>Friday Live!</em> streams to distract you from the futility of Friday afternoons coming in the weeks ahead.</p>

<p>
	Food isn&rsquo;t just for eating. Just ask the suburban teenagers who use Mentos to make bottle rockets, or the &quot;sploshers&quot; who get hard-ons for baked beans. There&#39;s also a long history of protesters using food as their weapon of choice. We&rsquo;re not talking razor blades embedded inside pizza crusts or watermelons shoved into cannons (although that&rsquo;d be pretty great), more the old school egg-in-the-face business that makes the recipient of some flying foodstuff look like an absolute tit. Having to wipe a thick film of viscous yolk from your eyes doesn&#39;t do wonders for a politician&#39;s gravitas.</p>
<p>
	Launching food missiles has long been a good middle ground for protesters who seek to make more of an impact than they would by handing out pamphlets but who don&#39;t&nbsp;<em>quite</em> want to drive a truckload of explosives through the palace gates. Last week, this logic led to the Russian consulate in Odessa resembling the aftermath of a stag do in Bella Italia. Apparently, in both Ukrainian and Russian, to &ldquo;hang noodles on one&#39;s ears&rdquo; means to be taking the piss, which is exactly what a group of Ukrainians felt that the Russian media were doing with their dubious coverage of the crisis in Crimea. And so they set about covering the fences and gates of the consulate with a healthy portion of noodles, garnished with a few liters of ketchup.</p>

<p>
	The first recorded instance of stickin&#39; it to the man with perishables dates back to 63 AD, when Vespasian, Roman governor of what is now Tunisia and Libya, was pelted with turnips. Protesting punitive policies and general financial hardship, his subjects rained an almighty veg storm down upon him, though there are no records relating to the protesters&#39; accuracy. There&rsquo;s irony in there somewhere, but, to be fair, turnips make better skull-bruisers than they do soups, so who can blame them? Despite his eventual rise to emperor, it seems foul foods plagued Vespasian to his last day, when he died from a severe case of diarrhea. Incidentally, his belief and wish that &ldquo;an emperor should die on his feet,&rdquo; coupled with an extreme case of the shits, must have made for quite an exit.</p>
<!--recommended--><p>
	Protest food has come a long way since the Roman turnip. One of the most brilliant modern-day examples is the cream pie. Beloved of the silent film directors of the early part of the last century, the cream pie was popularized as a form of protest in the 1970s. In fact, there are many activist groups who have based their entire ethos on the cream pie, including Al Pieda, the Biotic Baking Brigade, and the Entartistes, a member of which goes by the name of Pope Tart. You probably wouldn&#39;t want to spend much time with these people, but at least there&#39;s some flair for wordplay.</p>
<p>
	One of the earliest and most notable pieings was visited upon Anita Bryant, a pop sensation from 1950s USA who famously hated gays. While <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS91gT3XT_A" target="blank">trying to rationalize her prejudices</a> at a press conference in 1977, she received a substantial pie to the face from a gay-rights campaigner. Stranger than the pieing itself was the reaction: The thrower was instantly restrained and made to wait while Bryant and her husband fell immediately into prayer, presumably in an attempt to save his gay, pie-throwing soul. Give &quot;cream pie&quot; a quick google nowadays, and perhaps you&#39;ll look to the heavens, too, as you&#39;re confronted with an array of clowns and gross porn vaginas.</p>

<p>
	For some malcontents, the choice of food is symbolic. The Greek practice of y<em>aourtama</em>, for example, is the act of throwing yogurt over someone as a form of protest. The practice seems to have originated among the Greek teddy boys of the 50s, who took to yogurting the &quot;squares&quot; of their day. The popularity of the trend was accelerated by the introduction of plastic pots (as opposed to ceramic), giving birth to perfect, portable yogurt bombs. It became such an issue that, in 1958, the Greek government introduced the controversial Law 4000 to curb it. Under the law, anyone caught slinging tzatziki or the like at his elders could be arrested, have his head shaved and the turn-ups in his jeans snipped before being paraded through the streets of Athens like a prize cow with weird pants on.</p>
<p>
	This draconian law was abolished in the 80s, but the power of yaourtama lives on, with the recent economic crisis in Greece sparking a fresh round of both fist and yogurt dousings. In 2012, days after Greek reporter Panagiotis Vourhas interviewed Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris on his show, protesters&mdash;apparently aggrieved that Kasidiaris was allowed the airtime&mdash;broke into the news studio and gave Vourhas what has to be one of the most accurate and effective yogurtings in history.</p>
<p>
	Look at it. It just keeps coming:</p>
<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/lM8aIdpzPec" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	It&#39;s not just the Greeks taking their national cuisine to the frontline, though. You&#39;ll probably remember that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKwUHeWn2Eo" target="blank">back in March 2009</a>, Peter Mandelson copped a face full of green custard due to his support for a third runway at Heathrow. It wasn&#39;t quite the Euromaidan&mdash;rather, one mumsy woman from a group called Plane Stupid going a bit nuts in a gillet. The whole episode is so awkwardly British I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t shake hands afterwards. Still, it was a pretty good shot, and there remain only two runways at Heathrow, so it must have done the trick. It is also rumoured that die-hard Diana fans once ambushed Camilla Parker Bowles in a Sainsbury&#39;s parking lot and nailed her with bread rolls. Those crazy fuckers.</p>
<p>
	While the vast majority of history&#39;s youth-led food protests have been carried out by progressive types, a group of Australian schoolboys bucked the trend in 2013, when they threw sandwiches at Prime Minister Julia Gillard on two separate occasions. It was argued <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/05/31/why_must_australian_prime_minister_julia_gillard_dodge_sandwiches_during.html"> by <em>Slate</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that the attacks were deliberately symbolic of the sexist &quot;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/make-me-a-sandwich" target="_blank">make me a sandwich</a>&quot; meme, to remind the Prime Minister that a woman&#39;s real place is in the kitchen, not bloody parliament! But these were 15-year-old boys, and as frightening as it would be to think that Australia is overrun with teenage misogynists, Gillard laughed off the sandwich assault as &quot;a little act of high jinks.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Still, Gillard is gone now. And you know who the new prime minister of Australia is? A massive misogynist.</p>
<p>
	<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xbde5czKlhU" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
	But there is one particular food item that surpasses all others in the food-weapons arms race. Loved by anarchists and trick-or-treaters alike is the egg, a.k.a. a portable, well-weighted capsule of explosive, foul-smelling chicken ovum. Another Labor Party OG was involved in one of the most famous eggings of recent times. In 2001, a disgruntled farmer with a mullet threw an egg point-blank at the then-deputy prime minister, John Prescott, in protest against the Blair government&#39;s lack of support for farmers. Prescott, a former boxer, responded with a food protest of his own and threw one of his righteous <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XTiI1e-wVc" target="blank">fists of ham</a> into the face of the young Lovejoy lookalike.</p>
<p>
	Other famous egg receivers (&quot;eggees&quot;?) include Arnold Schwarzenegger (brushed it off like a boss), Ed Miliband (laughed it off like it happened all the time), David Blaine (egged when he was living in that glass box, so probably too hungry to give a shit), everyone&#39;s favorite racist, Nick Griffin (bundled away by security like a hysterical guest on <em>Jerry Springer</em>), and the recently deposed Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. Not everyone handles an egging well, or any covering with a foodstuff, even if on camera. Would you, if your eyelashes were sticking together with bits of shell and unfertilized baby chicken? Perhaps it&#39;s a measure of an individual&#39;s confidence, his ease with his position and the pitfalls that come with it, that determines how well a person handles a run-by egging.</p>
<p>
	By this logic, Yanukovych had no hope. During his first presidential election campaign he was struck by an egg as he stepped off the bus. After a quick examination of the mess on his jacket, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP0vWkqOQT8" target="blank">he promptly hit the floor as if he&#39;d been shot</a>. Maybe it was hard-boiled.</p>

<title>Will Egypt&#039;s Mass Death Sentence Provoke More Violence?</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144355/477009119.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 395px;" /></p>

<p>
	Yesterday, an Egyptian court <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/egypt-sentences-529-muslim-brotherhood-members-to-death-20140324-hvmbj.html" target="_blank">sentenced 529</a> alleged Muslim Brotherhood supporters to death&mdash;<a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egypt-more-500-sentenced-death-grotesque-ruling-2014-03-24" target="_blank">the largest single batch</a> of simultaneous death sentences issued in recent memory, according to Amnesty International. The condemned are accused of attacking a police station in the Minya governorate, just south of Cairo, last year, stealing weapons, killing an officer, and trying to kill two more.</p>
<p>
	Even though many of them are still protesting their innocence, it took only two days to find more than 500 people guilty of killing one man. That stands in stark contrast to the fact that, more than three years after the first Egyptian uprising, <a href="http://madamasr.com/content/court-acquits-last-remaining-officers-trial-killing-protesters" target="_blank">not one police officer</a> has been convicted of killing protesters&mdash;despite the hundreds of civilian deaths at the hands of security services during those 18 days.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s not much of a surprise that this will go down as one of the quickest&mdash;as well as one of the largest&mdash;mass death penalty sentences in history. The trial began on Saturday and finished on Monday, and normal legal procedures, or even a vague sense of due process, were almost completely ignored.&nbsp;Defense lawyers said they had no time to read the 3,000-page case file and weren&rsquo;t allowed to question witnesses for the prosecution.</p>
<p>
	When the judge announced the death sentences, no&nbsp;witnesses had been cross-examined, and the majority of defendants and&nbsp;their lawyers had been excluded from the courtroom.</p>
<p>
	&quot;This is the collapse of the justice system in Egypt,&quot; said Ali Kamal, one of the lawyers for the accused.</p>
<p>
	The event that the condemned took part in was just one of many aggressive acts against police and Christian property following the deaths of <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/muslim-brotherhood-chief-arrested-as-death-toll-hits-900/31556/" target="_blank">around 900 people</a> during the clearance of a Cairo sit-in last August, which was led by the Brotherhood in opposition to <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/vice-news/egypt-after-morsi-full-length" target="_blank">their ousting from power </a>the previous month.</p>
<p>
	The verdict is yet another sign that Egypt&#39;s establishment has no intention of easing up on Brotherhood supporters, with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/abuse-claims-rife-as-egypt-admits-jailing-16000-islamists-in-eight-months-9195824.html" target="_blank">more than 16,000</a> already arrested since former president and Brotherhood member Mohamed Morsi was deposed by the military in July of last year.</p>
<p>
	Thankfully, it&#39;s likely that a more reasonable judge will eventually overturn the sentence and maybe even the guilty verdict, and the country&#39;s leading religious official also has the option to commute the verdict. But in the meantime, the convicted and their families must live in the shadow of an imminent execution.</p>

<p>
	Yesterday, I spoke to one of those sentenced to death, as well as five family members of the condemned. They said that none of the accused were guilty, which is slightly questionable&mdash;someone was murdered, after all. But it clearly doesn&#39;t take more than 500 people to kill one man.</p>
<p>
	One man said that his brother, who was sentenced to death in absentia, was profoundly disabled and would be physically incapable of attacking a policeman. Another, a medical student in hiding at a friend&#39;s house, told me that he had been hundreds of miles away at the time the police station was attacked.</p>
<p>
	More than 400 of the defendants are not in custody. Ezzat Mohamed, who&rsquo;s currently in hiding away from his home in Minya, is one of them. His wife, Nihad, said that he was innocent and called the sentence a &quot;tragedy,&rdquo; adding that her four children&mdash;aged from six to 17 years&mdash;were finding it hard to understand what was happening.</p>
<p>
	She kept repeating in Arabic, &quot;Allah suffices for me, for he is the best disposer of affairs,&quot; a line from the Qur&rsquo;an that the devout use to soothe themselves in times of trouble.</p>
<p>
	Her 17-year-old daughter, Nada, spoke to me on the phone in broken English. &quot;It&#39;s a horrible feeling, that you lost someone from your family,&quot; she said. &quot;My father is a very kind, respectable person.&quot;</p>
<p>
	She paused, before reverting to Arabic and whispering, &ldquo;Down with the military government.&quot;</p>
<p>
	The sheer volume of the sentences and the grotesque flippancy surrounding them will surely do nothing but harden the polarization between supporters of Morsi&#39;s Brotherhood and backers of the military-installed administration, which <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-26323638" target="_blank">resigned unexpectedly</a> yesterday, paving the way for Commander-in-Chief Abdel Fattah al Sisi to make a bid for the country&rsquo;s presidency.</p>
<p>
	Haithem Zeidan, a lawyer practicing in Cairo, who describes himself as &quot;pro-army,&quot; told me that the death penalty decision was not final and would probably be reversed, but said that he welcomed it anyway. Like millions of other Egyptians, he believes the Brotherhood are a terrorist organization, as they were officially designated by the interim government last December (though no evidence has been provided to support the classification).</p>
<p>
	&quot;This verdict reduces the terrorist movement and deters them from doing these things again,&quot; said Zeidan. Like many, he believes that harsh repression is a legitimate and effective deterrent against the Islamist opposition.</p>
<p>
	Things could get even worse today, as 683 more people accused of involvement in the Minya violence are appearing before the same judge. One of the accused is Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of the Brotherhood, the organization&rsquo;s leading figure.</p>
<p>
	Beyond the Brotherhood, there is a group of militants who have taken to shooting individual policeman dead while they&#39;re isolated at checkpoints. Some young Brotherhood activists are now moving closer to the idea that &quot;anything below bullets&quot; is an acceptable response to state violence, including targeting individual officials for nonlethal reprisal attacks.</p>
<p>
	If Mohammed Badie is sentenced to death&mdash;and even if that sentence is ultimately commuted&mdash;it&#39;s likely that the response from Brotherhood members won&#39;t be nearly as restrained as it has been in the past.</p>

<title>Black Magic in the Central African Republic</title>

	<em>Black magic </em>gri-gri <em>bracelets</em></p>
<p>
	The <a href="https://news.vice.com/video/the-devil-tried-to-divide-us-war-in-the-central-african-republic-part-1-of-5" target="_blank">crisis in the Central African Republic</a> has now been going on for more than a year, with violence between Christian and Muslim militias <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/centralafricanrepublic/10711775/Bloodbath-in-prospect-in-the-Central-African-Republic.html" target="_blank">sparking very real fears</a> of a Rwandan-style genocide. In fact, clashes between groups from the Christian Anti-Balaka and the largely Muslim S&eacute;l&eacute;ka&mdash;both of them umbrella militia organizations&mdash;have already left around 1,000 dead and more than a million displaced, with civilians being caught in the middle and burned, shot, or even <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2542662/Footage-emerged-cannibal-eating-leg-Muslim-Central-African-Republic.html" target="_blank">eaten</a> purely on the basis of their religion.</p>
<p>
	While in Bangui, the country&rsquo;s capital, my cameraman Leo and I met Emotion, the leader of one of the local Anti-Balaka militias. They say they are attacking Muslims to prevent Islamist hard-liners from taking control of the country, but their indiscriminate attacks on entire communities suggest there may be more of a sectarian motive at play&mdash;and, understandably, the Anti-Balaka have acquired a pretty horrendous reputation for killing innocent Muslims in cold blood.</p>
<p>
	With that in mind, Emotion (who got his name because he cries a lot, though apparently out of passion, not fear) said he wanted to show us how well organized and peaceful his militia was. But before we set off to meet his men, Emotion said he had something to collect. Pulling the car over, he shouted out the window to one of his comrades, who rushed over to hand him a necklace made out of a few large leather squares.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for my protection,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better than body armor. When I wear it, bullets and machetes can&rsquo;t touch me. Even rockets can&rsquo;t kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Is it magic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s called <em>gri-gri</em>,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>
	With the necklace in hand, Emotion drove us to a checkpoint manned by his militia. Stepping out of the car, we asked if we could film some of the guys hanging around, all of whom were wearing gri-gri.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; one of them replied, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t be able to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m invisible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/143844/Emotion.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Emotion with his gri-gri necklace</em></p>
<p>
	I looked at the men sitting around him, expecting to catch someone sniggering. But there was no reaction, just a bunch of nonplussed faces staring back at me. Back in the car, I told our driver Harve&mdash;a sensible-seeming local&mdash;about our new invisible friend, expecting him to crack a smile.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He might be right,&rdquo; Harve said. &ldquo;A lot of people are invisible here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I couldn&rsquo;t agree with him then and there, but promised to check our footage before passing final judgment.</p>
<p>
	Driving back into town, we stopped to film the French and African soldiers who were searching vehicles as they passed through military checkpoints. The French officer in charge came over for a chat, which mostly amounted to him telling me what a great job the French army was doing. I asked him whether the African soldiers working alongside the French also believed in magic, or if they too wore the gri-gri.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Some of them do, but I prefer this,&rdquo; he replied, tapping his body armor.</p>
<p>
	Christianity is the majority religion in the Central African Republic, with Islam and animism making up the two largest minority faith groups. However, most people&mdash;regardless of their religion&mdash;have as much faith in magic as they do in the Bible or Qur&rsquo;an. For instance, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/06/hex-appeal/308103/" target="_blank">about 40 percent</a> of all prosecutions in the country involve witchcraft in some way, with lawyers often instructing their clients not to cast any spells while in custody. Shapeshifting into animals is also apparently a pretty popular pastime.</p>
<p>
	So it was no huge surprise that so many soldiers appeared to believe that small leather patches could protect them from live ammunition, even though it seemed absurd to our dull Western worldview. In a bid to find out where these beliefs came from, we asked Harve to take us to a witch doctor, who we hoped could explain what exactly you need to do to treated cowhide to make the wearer both invisible and invincible.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/143845/Philippe.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Philippe the witch doctor</em></p>
<p>
	In a town on the outskirts of Bangui, we were ushered into a small, dark one-room hut, which was decorated with a picture of Jesus and some frayed posters of various former Central African presidents.</p>
<p>
	We sat on some plastic chairs, and in a few minutes Philippe, a witch doctor in his mid 30s, wearing khakis and a Dolce &amp; Gabbana T-shirt, appeared. He told us that the war in his country had been good for business. He&rsquo;d been supplying gri-gri to the Anti-Balaka militias&mdash;which he claimed had played a pivotal role in their defeat of the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka rebels.</p>
<p>
	Leo explained that he spent a lot of time working in dangerous places, so he needed something to protect him from bullets and rockets. Philippe laid out his herbs, explaining what each one did. We had agreed on a price of about $100 (more than 50 times the average daily wage in the country) and wanted to pay half now and half on delivery the next day.</p>
<p>
	Philippe said no, telling us we had to pay about $80 right then and $20 the next day. We agreed, deciding it was probably best not to argue with a witch doctor. Harve then asked to get some anti-magic injections to protect him from dark magic, explaining that he needed a refill.</p>
<p>
	We returned the next day to find Philippe exactly where we left him. After exchanging pleasantries, he showed us Leo&rsquo;s magic new accessory.</p>
<p>
	All that was left to do before Leo could waltz through a war zone without any body armor was for Philippe to read us the small print. &ldquo;When wearing this gri-gri, you must not touch a woman who is on her period, or it will cease to work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must also not walk under a washing line with women&rsquo;s underwear on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	This went on for a while&mdash;the magic&#39;s limitations seemed to mainly revolve around the menstrual cycle. I was distracted by this apparent obsession of Philippe&rsquo;s at first, but soon realized that he was inadvertently responding to a question that had been bothering me: How does he explain it when a fighter, wearing gri-gri, is shot and dies? How does he justify his gear&#39;s ineffectiveness?</p>
<p>
	￼ This period preoccupation seemed to be the answer. If he tells everyone that the wearer must have touched his partner while she was menstruating (or had walked under a washing line) without taking off his gri-gri, Philippe gets off scot-free.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Philippe&#39;s magical herbs</em></p>
<p>
	After Philippe had given Leo his gri-gri, he asked me why I hadn&rsquo;t bought one of his necklaces. I could have replied with my first thought (&quot;Because you&rsquo;re a scam artist, and $100 is a lot of money for some magic string&quot;), but instead found myself trying to explain through Harve that I had run out of money and couldn&rsquo;t possibly afford it.</p>
<p>
	I then asked Harve to tell him that I would be back in the Central African Republic soon and would buy a necklace on my return. Being in a country where everyone believes in magic&mdash;and sitting in front of a man who claims to use it himself&mdash;I guess I believed for a brief moment, too, because I was definitely very worried that Philippe would cast some kind of gruesome spell on me if I didn&#39;t promise to buy one of his trinkets.</p>
<p>
	Back at the hotel, we checked the footage from the previous couple of days. To our astonishment, the man who claimed to be invisible was standing there in plain sight.</p>
<p>
	Magic in the Central African Republic seems a lot like a religion in itself, in that people use their faith in gri-gri as a kind of security blanket&mdash;a make-believe presence that keeps them courageous when they should be fearful. But while there&#39;s nothing wrong with relying on your religion for personal strength, it&#39;s a little harder to endorse shaman swindlers who charge militias a small fortune for something that&#39;s going to give them extra confidence while they&#39;re slaughtering a bunch of innocent men, women, and children.</p>

<title>I Dumpster-Dived with a Bunch of Freegans</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144418/dumpster-diving.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Look at that haul. All photos by the author</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	So there I was, groping around in a pile of trash in the middle of the night. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	People stared at the spectacle of a dozen dumpster divers carrying recyclable Trader Joe&rsquo;s bags through NYC&rsquo;s Upper East Side neighborhood. They didn&rsquo;t look like they needed handouts, but they were digging through the trash in the streets not too far from Park Avenue. They were calling it &ldquo;a movement.&rdquo; These people are freegans: a group dedicated to saving food, shampoo, furniture, and anything else that people waste. They want to fight the system of consumerism because they believe it squanders the stuff people need. No one was homeless. On any given night, this meetup group hooks bagel stalkers from different age brackets and socioeconomic backgrounds with their e-mail newsletter. I saw a college kid break bread with a veteran. Each diver has different standards and different favorite foods, but they all share a bootstrapper&rsquo;s mentality and are almost always on the hunt for things that are free. The food was for us, friends, people on the street&mdash;anything to keep it from piling up in a landfill. When someone throws something away, legally it&#39;s a public item, but that doesn&#39;t keep police and restaurant owners from hassling them.</p>
<p class="p1">
	There were people who survived solely on what they found, and people who dived twice a month who were just in it for the free food. And there was a lot of it.</p>
<p class="p1">
	The inventory from the biggest haul came from Gristedes grocery story: bottles of kombucha, stacks of pre-packaged guacamole and hummus, watermelons, peppers, breads, celery, salads, and packages of tri-colored fettuccine. It&rsquo;s like this outside most grocery stores every night, but Saturdays are when the masses clean most stores out. There was plenty to go around for everyone&rsquo;s personal stash and for the group feast that would happen tomorrow night. The leader gave me the address on a slip of paper.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>The haul from Gristedes</i></p>
<p class="p3">
	I&rsquo;d been curious about freeganism for years. I wanted to know what a dive was like, what freegans considered cool to salvage and how hardcore it was. It shocked me that I wasn&rsquo;t grossed out. But jacking $50 worth of pristine quinoa salads tossed into the garbage required so little effort. There wasn&rsquo;t so much &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; in the bag. I was relieved that there were no discarded napkins or coffee filters to scrounge through; it was just a bag of salads and wraps in their packaging that had expired that day. &ldquo;Companies are conservative with their expiration dates,&rdquo; Janet, our leader, explained.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I looked over to a mild-mannered Wes Anderson doppelg&auml;nger who worked as an intern at a Chelsea gallery as he pointed a flashlight to reveal packages of Japanese sweet potatoes. A woman offered me a container of cold gazpacho she pulled just because I said I loved it, but I told her to keep it. A Brooklyn freegan once told me that people can get cagey about their prime spots, but most freegans believe in sharing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I scooped out a filmy $12 bag of shiitake mushrooms from Dean &amp; Deluca for the feast the next night. There were no takers for the bag of loose pieces of Swiss cheese because a regular diver, Adam, wasn&rsquo;t there. Adam&rsquo;s known for dunking his hand into unwrapped food and eats right out of the garbage.</p>
<p class="p1">
	As people walked by, they took interest in the operation going on. Some passerby swiped a still-soft chocolate chip cookie from the huge pile without stopping. A man slipped into the crowd trying to hide his grocery bags from Gristedes. &ldquo;This proves it&rsquo;s a bad economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all suffering, right?&rdquo; Then he walked off; he must have decided earlier that even though he was suffering, he preferred to pay for his guacamole.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144421/dumpster-dive-bag.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p3">
	A recently unemployed woman ate her salad wrap rescued from outside of Organic Avenue.</p>
<p class="p3">
	&ldquo;At least you&rsquo;re being resourceful,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;Yeah. It helps,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;Would you go alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel too weird.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
	I had to consider if I would. I imagined myself all alone, checking out the trash in broad daylight, looking not exactly pathetic but whatever is one level less nuts than that. I decided it wasn&rsquo;t worth it. I was still marveling at how inviting and brightly colorful it all looked on the curb when it was time to tie up the rejects&mdash;bananas browned from days of neglect&mdash;and move on. Dumpster divers leave garbage sites nicer than they were before. They have that in common with Girl Scouts.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Being an amateur myself, I picked up some slimy garbage in hopes of finding something edible, and accidentally discarded it in a fellow diver&rsquo;s general direction. A yellow rubber glove appeared in front of my face.</p>
<p class="p1">
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I wore these,&rdquo; a fellow diver named Mohammed said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144426/dumpster-dive.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Look how much fun we&#39;re having!</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	The Italian market Agata &amp; Valentina, the most upscale target on our hit list, was a bust. It was closed, but lust-worthy aromas of the prepared foods inside reached every corner of my nose. Outside, I lifted a bag of severed pineapple tops to find a ton of raw meat. Too scrappy. Too much work for the group.</p>
<p class="p1">
	We moved on, passing V-Note, a vegan restaurant. It would have been awkward to hit them up, what with everyone enjoying dinner and all. &ldquo;We could claw at the window and go through their trash while they ate,&rdquo; Cindy, the sarcastic leader said, laughing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Dragging my free broccoli home, I had sticky ice cream hands thanks to some suspicious goo that collects on salad in a bag. It&rsquo;s cool. I scrubbed my hands six times like I was reenacting Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s OCD post-murder hand washing.</p>
<p class="p1">
	The next night was the feast, located in a residential building in East Harlem. They hold them to reward people who find food and share it. I set about chopping garlic, onions, and celery in the communal kitchen. My first task was simple enough: get rid of the mealy bits on the tomato with a cleaver. People come if they&rsquo;ve been on the dive the night before, or they find something to bring in on their own. One woman produced potatoes and had prolonged their life span by separating them in her worn-to-death stockings.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144429/dumpster-dive-meal.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p1">
	Our rosemary bread was rock-hard, but it was nothing a microwave couldn&rsquo;t fix. &ldquo;I promise no one will get sick on this,&rdquo; a cheery leader said. A drunk guy stumbled in looking for chitlins. Almost everyone was vegan&mdash;mostly for &nbsp;moral reasons&mdash;so he gave up, but not before delivering a lecture on how an onion can heal a broken leg if you can&rsquo;t afford to go the hospital.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Every age bracket was represented at the dive, but at the feast, it was mostly people who were retired&mdash;an improv teacher, a former management consultant&mdash;and the lone young unemployed legal assistant. Not every diver survives on a strict freegan diet; some of them donate food they find to <a href="http://www.foodnotbombs.net/"><span class="s2">Food Not Bombs</span></a>, a collective that feeds people in need with rescued food in order to create a more sustainable future. One guy talked about the young kids who jump out of a van to take all the trash from Organic Avenue on 21<span class="s3"><sup>st</sup></span> Street. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so ragged they look like they live in the subway,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I stared at my dish, which would elate hungry people everywhere, feeling disappointed in myself. I worried about anorexia rumors.</p>
<p class="p1">
	Somehow, bagging up the &ldquo;rescued food&rdquo; seemed less dicey than the end result: eating it. Boxed spelt crackers and cranberry oatmeal cookies tasted the safest. The stir-fry smelled good enough, but those $12 mushrooms and the tofu were gray. However, I&rsquo;d pay full price for the asparagus, and the rice and beans were restaurant-quality.</p>
<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144430/dumpster-dive-meal-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="p1">
	These people were passionate and intelligent, but most of this stuff just wasn&rsquo;t appetizing. It still impressed me that all this food would go to waste if it weren&#39;t for them.</p>
<p class="p1">
	I went into this thinking <i>garbage... never good</i>. But it struck me: the stuff was fresh enough to eat, and I didn&rsquo;t poison myself. In the end, my own hangups about where it came from tugged at my stomach and got in the way of rational thinking. This was something I personally applauded, but didn&rsquo;t want to take up.</p>
<p class="p1">
	So I chewed, nodding to signal how impressed I was while I fantasized about tunneling myself into the nearest steakhouse for a rehabilitative lamb chop. I was the only one who wasn&rsquo;t into it; all the others finished their plates. As I washed the dishes, they invited me to dive again. But while they&rsquo;re onto something, I remain a slave to the system. I prefer to see my food on a clean shelf.</p>

<p>
	<em><strong>&quot;I twist, you shout.&quot;</strong></em></p>
<p>
	That&#39;s just one memorable line from a woman who practically breathed them, fueled by the most brilliantly poisoned oxygen, her words a veritable choke hold, an evisceration&mdash;our very own Lydia Lunch. Only she&#39;s not ours anymore. After almost single-handedly defining the pissed indifference of No Wave in late-70s New York with Teenage Jesus &amp; the Jerks, Beirut Slump, and 8-Eyed Spy, Lydia appears to have happily checked into a new age Hotel California. Appearances, however, can be deceiving when you&#39;re dealing with any high-octane brain once demonized and dismissed as &quot;confrontational.&quot; Those who bravely, at times recklessly, confront the more insidious evils, and where to begin? With the corporate death machine? With the police state? With the cadavers of aging White Male America who suffocate the intellectual and political aspirations of any group that doesn&#39;t blindly submit to its power? Praise God and pass the Viagra, and prepare to be screwed for another century at least.</p>
<p>
	If you can believe a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/22/magazine/finding-inner-peace-with-the-angriest-punk-of-70s-new-york.html?_r=0">recent story</a> in the Sunday Magazine of <em>The New York Crimes</em>, Lydia Lunch, now in her mid 50s, has re-imagined herself as a self-help guru in Ojai, California, the West Coast&#39;s answer to Shangri-La. Just how lost is this horizon? Taken at face value this might seem an odd career change for Lydia, but to those who know her history it makes a kind of perversely perfect sense. Teenage Lydia, from that noirish time, was the blunt instrument in all those bands. Her take-no-prisoners severity could clear a club within minutes, which I witnessed firsthand as one of the few who stayed behind. Lydia was a hybrid baby doll/gun moll/motormouth drill sergeant. Maybe self-help is borne of an intertwined damage and discipline, and Lydia, projecting both outward vulnerability and inner strength, was cut out for it from the very beginning.</p>
<p>
	In a 1979 interview with the <em>Soho Weekly News</em> she was asked:</p>
<p>
	<strong><em>SWN:&nbsp; </em></strong><em>Why do you play such short sets?</em><br />
	<strong><em>LL: Less is more. That&#39;s how I feel. Like discipline. Or punishment. You don&#39;t need 30 minutes of my music to know what I&#39;m talking about.</em></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong><em>SWN:&nbsp; </em></strong><em>Does a 30-second instrumental say it all?</em><br />
	<strong> <em>LL: Yes. It says &quot;FUCK!&quot; &quot;CHILD!&quot; &quot;HURT!&quot; &quot;FUCK!&quot;</em></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong><em>SWN:&nbsp; </em></strong><em>Is the minimalism very important? There&#39;s an absence of dynamics in the music, your words express very simple feelings. They don&#39;t even express an opinion. Would anything more compromise your opinion of the audience, which is very low?</em><br />
	<em><strong>LL:&nbsp; I never said that. Only that they&#39;re secondary, compared to me. I don&#39;t think more music is needed. And that attitude is what I feel. It&#39;s like primal therapy. I scream for you, you know. I&#39;m up there screaming my fucking guts out. It&#39;s for you as much as for me, only I&#39;d be&hellip;</strong></em></p>
<p>
	<strong><em>SWN: The last to admit it.</em><sup>&quot;1</sup></strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	And now, 35 years and 3,000 miles away, in the tranquil garden of the Ananda Verandah, out in that golden West, where the possibilities for growth are always exploited, that admission has, in a sense, finally been made. But if we travel back in time to the late 70s, and even further, to that decade&#39;s antithesis, the late 60s, you have to ask: <em>What sort of second act is possible after an annihilation?</em> As Lydia herself would be quick to point out, many of us don&rsquo;t have a first act, let alone a second. While an amped-up life can negate or make ridiculous whatever follows, we shouldn&#39;t be too hasty in our judgment. Because what passes for justice in this country tends to be delivered by those who remain safely on the sidelines, where basic values are fiercely protected even when rotten to the core. From inside that mealy apple, fallen not far from the tree, a lowly worm wriggles out to demand: Is there life after life? Far preferable that he slithers out from the fruit of the original sin than from the hollow socket of your eye. As Anne Sexton, the great confessional poet and eventual suicide, pointedly if flatly observed: &quot;Most people&#39;s lives aren&#39;t interesting enough for a play.&quot;</p>

<p>
	Scanning the article I couldn&#39;t help wondering,&nbsp;<em>Where do you go from Teenage Jesus or, for that matter, the Black Panthers?</em> Bobby Seale co-founded the Black Panther Party for Self Defense with Huey Newton in 1966. The indelible image of BPP members defiantly armed with rifles, some with ammunition belts across their chests, on the steps of the California State Capitol in Sacramento, on a spring afternoon in 1967, is just as riveting and unbelievable nearly 50 years later. And so is an image&mdash;captured only in a drawing, for an incendiary photo would have surely promoted their cause&mdash;of Seale, bound and gagged in a Chicago courtroom in &#39;68. The image belies the very notion of free speech. It also serves as a reminder that although show trials were first staged in the counter-revolutionary USSR, they later played to packed houses right here in the good ol&#39; USSA (and still do, only now they&#39;re conducted behind closed doors on a military base). The Panthers knew the FBI would try to hunt them down and silence them, but there are times when a lesson and a life must be laid on the line, for where self-preservation and self-determination are one and the same the consequence of one&#39;s actions will never outweigh those of inaction. And the price of admission? Some paid with their lives, some with their minds. Those who survived may never escape a lingering sense that to endure is not so much a victory as a matter of having been left behind. Then again, can you spend an entire life walking the streets with a loaded gun? These days, caught between self-help and self-determination, you have to ask: <em>Do you carry a yoga mat or a rifle? Or do you carry a weapon wrapped inside the mat?</em></p>
<p>
	<em><img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144261/lydiabobbycookbooks.jpg" style="width: 636px; height: 398px;" /></em></p>
<p>
	In the wake of the turbulence, decimation, and disillusion of the 60s and 70s, Seale, in his second act, went on to work as a talk-radio host and to author a book titled <em>Barbeque&#39;n with Bobby</em>, filled with his down-home recipes as a way of raising funds for progressive, socially engaged groups that were struggling under Reaganism. (Lydia published a collection of her own recipes in 2012, called <em>The Need to Feed</em>.) And as easy as it might be to mock him, just as it was easier to focus on guns over butter, Seale&#39;s initiative can be seen to parallel the Panthers&#39; community activism. Particularly the free food program that began in Oakland in &#39;69 and grew exponentially, with free breakfasts offered to many thousands of poor school children nationwide.</p>
<p>
	Seale&#39;s onetime brother-in-arms, Eldridge Cleaver, reinvented himself in another way entirely. His unexpected trajectory delivered him light years from the radicality of his earlier days, slipping sideways into absurdist radical chic with his outrageously irreverent &ldquo;dick pants&rdquo;&mdash;no concealed weapons here&mdash;to the very doorstep of a billion-dollar corporation that, until fairly recently, held to their incredulous belief in the spiritual inferiority of blacks&mdash;yes, the Mormon Church. Cleaver&#39;s book, <em>Soul on Fire</em>, the follow-up to his 60s prison memoir, <em>Soul on Ice</em>, suggests that even a person who doesn&#39;t believe in a heavenly reward may one day confront the prospect of burning in hell. After becoming ensconced in the Church of Latter Day Saints, Cleaver, who had once dismissed Governor Ronald Reagan as a punk and a coward, would end up campaigning for the man when he ran for president, redefining that most misguided of notions: You can&#39;t get there from here.</p>

<p>
	In the end, there&#39;s really only one question to be raised&mdash;along with the white flag: How much further can you ascend or descend from Nirvana? This may refer to the state of enlightenment or to the gold-plated unit-shifters of grunge. Take your pick. The recent announcement that a Nirvana single which was set to be pressed and released almost 20 years ago to the week, then hastily deleted after Kurt Cobain checked out, would finally appear, led many to believe his hour of darkness would finally see the light of day. The single was pulled because of the record&rsquo;s B-side, a little number Cobain had titled &quot;I Hate Myself and Want to Die.&quot; He did&hellip; and he did. Even so, the song doesn&#39;t unlock any particular mysteries, since the title and the lyrics don&#39;t illuminate one another, or anything else. If you watch it online, preceded by a commercial for Charmin Ultra Strong, you&#39;ll gain about as much insight from the friendly stuffed bear. A nothing-special throwaway song, relegated to the flip-side of a single, then tossed onto a Beavis and Butt-Head CD, and now shamelessly resuscitated to shake a little more change out of the pockets of a corpse. (David Geffen can&#39;t possibly need the money. Does Courtney Love?)</p>
<p>
	While discontinuity is truer to the sense of human flow, where the button that&rsquo;s been depressed isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;play&rdquo; but &ldquo;repeat,&rdquo; reinvention of the self can become its own revolving door. That&rsquo;s delivering a product, chained to its care and maintenance, and the product is you. The popular term in business and the entertainment-industrial complex is branding. Maybe some of us would be a little less willing to be branded if it actually entailed bending over in front of a hot iron. Once you become someone else&rsquo;s property, the past is on rewind as you return to the memory of who you once were. Simultaneously the master and the unfaithful servant, the body is exhumed in a future that never happened. Bits of encrusted dirt and mud are rubbed from your eyelids, as fingers crumble from your desiccated hand, scattered by the wind across the dry, dusty ground. Yet the middle finger remains, and is raised above your lifeless form, the only friend&hellip; still true.</p>
<p>
	Even if Lydia fully understands the necrophiliac S&amp;M of the music industry, which isn&#39;t all that different from that of the film industry, the fashion industry (are you wearing McQueen this season?) or every other industry&mdash;not forgetting the art market&mdash;she wouldn&#39;t have been able to help Kurt Cobain. Neither could she have done anything for Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Foster Wallace, or Hunter S. Thompson, who referred to the lone well-intended but hopeless intervention of his friends as &quot;the Inquisition.&quot; Besides the impenetrable fact that you simply cannot help those who don&#39;t want to be helped&mdash;just try to counteract the centrifugal force of a person as he or she spirals further away from a center that will not hold&mdash;Lydia&#39;s services are not available to the male of the species. Her &quot;Post-Catastrophe&quot; workshop is only open to the so-called second sex, advertised thusly: &quot;Create an environment to Empower other women and Inspire artistic collaboration.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/13/Pennyroyal_Tea_Nirvana.jpg" style="width: 528px; height: 461px;" /></p>
<p>
	In what could serve as the opening scene for <em>The Life and Times of Lydia Lunch</em>, a monologue, though tirade seems more accurate, would be delivered to set the stage:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em>&quot;I can understand why women trade flesh for money, power, control. What I DON&rsquo;T GET IS WHY MEN ARE STILL STUPID ENOUGH TO FALL FOR IT. Ever since it was invented, Pussy has been treated as a magic elixir, a voodoo that some men just can&rsquo;t seem to resist or get enough of. The hyper-sexualization and commoditization of women in all forms of media, culture, and music has NOT BEEN TURNED ON ITS HEAD by middle aged pop-porn princesses running around in lame aerobics costumes playing braindead disco as they sell mega-units for mega-corporate record company pimps. More useless entertainment which tells us nothing and only serves as a distraction &hellip;&quot; </em><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>
	***</p>
<p>
	You have to wonder how Lydia would have reacted to Jane Fonda&#39;s second act as the queen of 80s aerobics after her anti-war activism in the 60s. Bobby Seale certainly felt a kinship with her reinvention, going so far as to acknowledge Fonda as an inspiration for his entrepreneurial foray into the BBQ pit. (Back in the day, she had been a very vocal and prominent supporter of the Panthers, and was under surveillance by the NSA for many years. Trading left-wing husband Tom Hayden for the ultra-rich neo-con Ted Turner might have appeased but not erased those associations.)</p>
<p>
	Fonda helped to set Americans on a course of exercise and more healthful living, giving birth to a craze that became a way of life, as well as big bucks&mdash;the fitness industry. And what would she have been doing instead? Remaking <em>Barbarella</em>? Maybe her workout tapes, numbering more than two dozen, which sold millions of copies, and millions of VCRs collaterally&mdash;can be spliced together with scenes from <em>Barbarella</em>, a fractured tribute to the woman without whom we might not have all those fabulous yoga and pilates studios, a $7 billion a year, seemingly recession-proof industry. Discussing this recently with the only person I know who goes to a yoga class, despite being into it and acknowledging the benefits, he struck a sour note, claiming that others attend less as a spiritual/physical thing than for their ego, as a way to show off. But while exhibitionists will always find a stage on which to perform, the evolution of Jane Fonda or Lydia or anyone who manages to successfully script for themselves a second act, and even a third, suggests something else: that the hardcore notion of being true to oneself is based on a one-dimensional image of a life, when the truth of life is that it&#39;s an unfolding, and to shed one skin for another is the visible sign of this process.</p>

	Self-help isn&#39;t for everyone, and the price of admission is both psychic and financial. If self-help seems to appeal primarily to a certain class&mdash;the ruling class and its devoted/indentured subjects&mdash;and that the cost of rehab with a stunning Pacific Ocean view is beyond most of us mere mortals, keep in mind that repression is most effectively and politely administered economically. And even if the spiel for Lydia&#39;s Post-Catastrophe workshop sounds at times like so much claptrap: &quot;Art has the ability to act as salve to the universal wound. It gives voice to the silent scream within us all. It rebels as pleasure in times of trauma. It brings a sense of beauty and joy by rising up in celebration of life, a direct contra-diction to the widespread brutality of socio-sadistic bullies who seek to divide and conquer.&quot; Yes, despite the cringe-inducing spiel, more power to her, and in every way. In an interview from 2010, Lydia sounded much closer to, shall we say, her old self, insisting that &quot;Pain always subsides, but wisdom, love, intensity, and genius feed the soul. And the soul is a <em>hungry motherfucker</em>.&quot; <sup>3</sup></p>
<p>
	Lydia Lunch is a survivor, not a casualty&mdash;or rather she&#39;s a casualty who lived to tell the tale, and now to help others. There are plenty of misfits from her gory glory days who aren&#39;t around anymore. But you know what? They don&#39;t give a fuck. That&#39;s the funny thing about consciousness. You&#39;re either here&hellip; or you&#39;re not. For some, self-help will always be the enemy within, and what of life? Which nowadays appears more and more <em>lifelike</em>. As the earliest new-agers, those blissfully enlightened nihilist-millionaires who tripped all the way to India down that long and windy road, told us oh so long ago, Life goes on within us, and without us.</p>
<p>
	You might as well live.</p>

	I&rsquo;m a British photographer and rabbit lover. When I moved to New York City in 2011 for work, I didn&rsquo;t get homesick, but I really missed my pet rabbit in London. To remedy this, I decided to visit some rabbit shows to get my bunny fix, which his how I ended up with a bunch of photographs of chubby rabbits from shows in Washington, Ohio, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	The Central African Republic&#39;s capital of Bangui has seen its Muslim population drop from 130,000 to under 1,000 during the past few months. Over the past year, thousands across CAR have been killed, and nearly a million have been displaced. The United Nations recently stated that the entire Western half of the country has now been cleansed of Muslims.<br />
	<br />
	CAR has never fully recovered from France&#39;s colonial rule, and it has only known ten years of a civilian government&mdash;from 1993 to 2003&mdash;since achieving independence in 1960. Coup after coup, often with French military involvement, has led many to refer to the country as a phantom state. The current conflict has now completely erased the rule of law, leaving the UN and international community looking confused and impotent.<br />
	<br />
	In March 2013, the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, a mostly Muslim rebel alliance, rose up and overthrew the corrupt government of Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute;, while bringing terror and chaos across the country&mdash;pillaging, killing, and raping with impunity. In response, mostly Christian self-defense forces, called the Anti-Balaka, formed to defend CAR against S&eacute;l&eacute;ka attacks.<br />
	<br />
	Clashes grew more frequent throughout 2013 as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka grew more ruthless. In December 2013, French and African troops went in to disarm the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka and staunch the bloodshed. The Anti-Balaka, seizing on a weakened S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, then went on the offensive.<br />
	<br />
	CAR had no real history of religious violence, and the current conflict is not based on any religious ideology. The fighting, however, turned increasingly sectarian in the fall of 2013, with revenge killings becoming the norm. And as the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka&#39;s power waned, the Anti-Balaka fed their need for revenge by brutalizing Muslim civilians.&nbsp;<br />
	<br />
	&quot;Too few peacekeepers were deployed too late; the challenge of disarming the S&eacute;l&eacute;ka, containing the Anti-Balaka, and protecting the Muslim minority was underestimated,&quot; Human Rights Watch said in a recent statement.<br />
	<br />
	The bloodshed has not stopped. The UN is still debating whether or not to send peacekeepers. Even if a peacekeeping operation is approved, it will take six months for troops to be assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<title>How Did Victor White III Die in the Backseat of a Cop Car?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/who-shoots-themselves-in-the-back-of-a-cop-car</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144262/victorwhite.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 477px;" /></p>
<p>
	<em><span class="photo_caption">Photos courtesy of the White family</span></em></p>
<p>
	The night Victor White Sr.&rsquo;s son <a href="http://www.iberianet.com/man-dies-lsp-probe-starts/article_757fb56e-a3b8-11e3-8e81-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">died in the backseat of a cop car</a> in New Iberia, Louisiana, he called the local sheriff&rsquo;s station to figure out where his boy was.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I asked them if he&rsquo;d been apprehended, and they told me no,&rdquo; he said to me. It wasn&rsquo;t until the following morning, March 3, that Victor Sr. found out his son, Victor White III, had been arrested and died while in police custody. But he didn&rsquo;t receive the news from the New Iberia Sheriff&#39;s Department&mdash;he got the call from his son Leonard, who also lives in New Iberia and had been questioned that morning by police in connection with the death of his brother.</p>
<p>
	Immediately, of course, Victor Sr. made the two-hour drive from his home in Alexandria down to New Iberia to find out what the hell was going on. But the cops refused to tell him anything about the circumstances surrounding his 22-year-old son&rsquo;s death, citing an ongoing investigation by the state police. At that point, Victor Sr. had no idea his son&#39;s death was caused by a gunshot to the back while he was still in handcuffs in the backseat of a patrol car. Every official he talked to was cagey.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t even let me see the body,&rdquo; Victor Sr. told me over the phone. Eventually, when they realized he wouldn&rsquo;t take &ldquo;no comment&rdquo; for an answer, they brought in the coroner and allowed Victor Sr. to take one look at his deceased son&mdash;but even then, they had conditions. &ldquo;They told me I couldn&rsquo;t see his lower body,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;I could only see his face.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Still completely in the dark about what had taken place, Victor drove back home in utter shock. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t until I got back and looked on the state police&#39;s Facebook page that I found out what had happened to my son.&rdquo; Even then, the official version of events opened up even more questions than answers.</p>
<p>
	Here&rsquo;s what is known at this point: On Sunday, March 2, Victor White III walked down to a convenience store with a friend to pick up a cigar. When he got there, a fight broke out&mdash;it&#39;s unclear if Victor and his friend were involved, but in any case the cops arrived on the scene shortly after the fight ended, stopped Victor a couple blocks from the store, and discovered that he had some unidentified narcotics on him. They cuffed his hands behind his back and put him in the back of their cruiser&mdash;and that&#39;s where the story stops making much sense.</p>
<p>
	The sheriff&#39;s deputies who arrested Victor III allege that when they arrived at the Iberia Parish Sheriff&#39;s Office, Victor III wouldn&#39;t leave the car and became &ldquo;uncooperative.&rdquo; They say he pulled out a handgun, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, and shot <em>himself</em> in the back.</p>
<p>
	I called the state police and the local sheriff&#39;s office to ask questions about whether Victor&#39;s last moments were caught on video, who the officers in question are, and how a suspect in police custody could have had a gun after being frisked, but no one would comment anything of substance since the shooting was being investigated. (This is standard operating procedure at police departments.)</p>
<p>
	Lieutenant Anthony Green, however, was willing to give his take on New Iberia&#39;s response to the shooting, stating, &ldquo;The community is not really up in arms about this. I don&#39;t sense any large unrest.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	This isn&rsquo;t the first time the Iberia Sheriff&#39;s Department has been suspected of brutalizing the people of New Iberia. Last year, a group of officers were caught on video beating a handcuffed man at the town&#39;s annual Sugar Cane Festival, an incident that led to a <a href="http://www.wdsu.com/news/around-louisiana/iberia-parish-deputy-fired-following-sugarcane-festival-incident/22363726">deputy&rsquo;s firing</a>. And at least a few activists are upset by this history of mistreatment. On March 11, Reverend Raymond Brown, a fast-talking New Orleans preacher, <a href="http://www.iberianet.com/news/brown-coverup/article_9e05a7b8-a9f9-11e3-8d4c-0019bb2963f4.html" target="_blank">hosted a small rally</a> in New Iberia and called for the US Justice Department and the FBI to investigate Victor&#39;s death.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We believe they murdered him,&quot; he told me over the phone. &quot;They shot him in the back and then drove him to the sheriff&rsquo;s office. We don&#39;t buy the police&rsquo;s story. If he&#39;s handcuffed around the back, it would be impossible for him to reach down and grab a gun like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144263/victorwhiteiii.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 498px;" /></p>
<p>
	To those close to Victor III, the claim that he would try pull out a gun and shoot himself while in the custody of police is just absurd.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;He was a respectable person. He went to church. It&rsquo;s so unusual for them to say he was &lsquo;uncooperative.&#39; And for them to say he shot himself, that&rsquo;s just unbelievable,&rdquo; said Victor Sr. &ldquo;I saw his face. I <em>know</em> they beat him before he arrived at the station, because those who were with him before he was arrested said he didn&rsquo;t have a mark on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	According to his father, Victor III&#39;s previous run-ins with the law were minor&mdash;the kind you&#39;d expect of any young man: He was caught once with pot, he got a traffic violation for making a U-turn a while back, and when he was 16 he broke someone&#39;s window. Local police officials, however, would not elaborate for me on Victor White III&rsquo;s criminal record, once again citing the ongoing investigation. But Victor Sr. said that at the time of his death, Victor III was getting his life on track: He&rsquo;d moved down to New Iberia in November to be with his girlfriend and his six-month-old daughter and was living out of a hotel called the Cajun Inn with one of his brothers, his girlfriend, and his baby. He&rsquo;d taken a job at the local Waffle House, but his long-term plan was to go to vocational school for welding. The day Victor III died, he told his dad over the phone that he was planning on using his $800 income tax refund, which he was carrying around that night in cash, to get a permanent home for his girl and his baby. Everything seemed to be falling in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Outraged and dissatisfied, Victor Sr. and his family have banded together to try and get to the bottom of what happened to Victor White III. They&rsquo;ve hired attorney Carol Powell Lexing, who gained statewide recognition for her work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jena_Six">Jena Six</a> case. Severely skeptical of the state investigation and the local police, Victor Sr. and the White family have also created a <a href="http://www.gofundme.com/7ductk" target="_blank">campaign to raise funds</a> for an independent autopsy and crime-scene tests. Simply put, they&#39;re tired of waiting to hear from the police.</p>
<p>
	&quot;My family has <em>no</em> closure, because there are all these&nbsp;questions still looming over us,&quot; Victor Sr. said to me in a moment of reflection and lamentation. &quot;I&#39;m just in disbelief. I still call out his name. I still think I&#39;m going to wake up from this nightmare.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>UPDATE: </strong>According to the White family&#39;s lawyer,&nbsp;Carol Powell Lexing, there is video footage that confirms Victor III was not involved in the fight outside the New Iberian convenient store, which caused the police to arrive on the scene and stop and question him.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Will &#039;Smart Drugs&#039; Really Make Us Smarter, or Just Ruin Our Lives?</title>

<p>
	It&rsquo;s not exactly news that people do drugs in college. But in recent years there&rsquo;s been a flurry of reports from both <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2012/oct/24/smart-drugs-would-you-try-them" target="_blank">the UK</a> and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/05/16/nootropics-can-these-smart-drugs-super-charge-your-career/" target="_blank">h</a><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/05/16/nootropics-can-these-smart-drugs-super-charge-your-career/">ere in the US</a> that suggest students are increasingly getting high to help them do their work, rather than to block out its existence until the day it&#39;s due.</p>
<p>
	The majority of media attention awarded to these &ldquo;smart drugs&rdquo; so far has been directed at their misuse, given that some of the most popular substances&mdash;like Ritalin, Adderall, and modafinil&mdash;were originally developed to combat specific disorders, such as ADHD or narcolepsy. But there&rsquo;s also been a steady rise in the use of supplements designed to improve brainpower in healthy adults over extended periods of time, as opposed to the brief but efficient effect you&rsquo;ll get from using any of the time-tested prescription drugs.</p>
<p>
	These supplements are known as nootropics and range from the mundane (ginseng) to the unpronounceable (phenylalanine). As with the prescription drugs, little is known about their long-term side effects.</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s difficult to draw any clear distinctions between nootropics and other brain-boosting drugs, but if you, like many others, share the views of John Harris&mdash;professor of bioethics at Manchester University in England&mdash;there&rsquo;s very little need to draw those distinctions in the first place. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in cognitive-enhancing drugs,&quot; he said. &quot;How you define nootropics doesn&rsquo;t interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Of course, not everyone agrees. Corneliu E Giurgea, a Romanian psychologist and chemist, synthesized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam" target="_blank">piracetam</a>&mdash;the first nootropic&mdash;in 1964 and established an exact set of criteria in doing so. For Giurgea, nootropics must enhance learning acquisition, increase the coupling of the brain&rsquo;s hemispheres, and improve executive processing (that last one involves tasks such as planning, paying attention, and spatial awareness). Importantly, these drugs must also be non-toxic and non-addictive.</p>
<p>
	Due to the wide variety of supplements classed as nootropics, there&rsquo;s no single way of explaining how they work. Broadly speaking, however, nootropics achieve their effects by altering the supply of neurochemicals, enzymes, or hormones in the brain. Giurgea&rsquo;s piracetam, for example, can improve the memory of users by altering the levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which, in turn, affects the plasticity of synapses in the brain (the extent to which entire brain structures, and the brain itself, can change from experiences). We understand our memories to be composed of complex matrices of synapses, and our ability to access them is related to how well they can link. Improved plasticity makes it easier for synapses to hook up.</p>
<p>
	Three of the most popular British vendors (Nootropics.co.uk, Intellimeds.co.uk, and SmartNootropics.co.uk) have all appeared in the last two years, so it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s been a recent surge in the popularity of nootropics. However, the benefits of some of the substances used to make the supplements have been known for years. We all know the productivity perks of caffeine, for instance, and the brain-boosting power of fish oil has been touted for as long as any of us can remember (with or without the help of nootropics). For those reasons, caffeine and fish oil form the base of many nootropic &ldquo;stacks&rdquo;&mdash;super-effective nootropic combinations.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Image by Jonny Mellor</em></p>
<p>
	Sean Duke is an American neuropharmacologist who specializes in devising stacks. He refers to those who take nootropics as &ldquo;noonauts&rdquo; and claims that they &quot;are the mental equivalent of bodybuilders.&quot; On the nootropics <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/" target="_blank">Subreddit</a>&mdash;and a number of other online message boards&mdash;noonauts from all corners of society come together to obsess over drug regimens and optimizing doses and boast about how many books they can mentally bench-press.</p>
<p>
	Duke&rsquo;s steroids allegory also works on a legal level. As with all drugs, the government&rsquo;s method for legislating cognitive enhancers is scattershot at best. Modafinil&mdash;a substance created to treat narcolepsy&mdash;<a href="http://www.nhs.uk/medicine-guides/pages/MedicineOverview.aspx?condition=Narcolepsy&amp;medicine=modafinil&amp;preparationModafinil%20100mg%20tablets" target="_blank">cannot be sold legally without a prescription</a>&nbsp;in the UK, but it&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1htq0e/legality_of_buying_modafinil_from_overseas_in_the/" target="_blank">is legal</a> to import for personal use. <a href="http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Piracetam" target="_blank">The same goes</a> for piracetam. This creates a pretty illogical situation in which UK suppliers can sell experimental nootropics unimpeded but cannot legally sell piracetam&mdash;a substance that has been thoroughly proven as safe for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>
	Duke says of humans, &ldquo;We are all nootnauts; some of us just try harder.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s a sentiment that&rsquo;s been true throughout our history. Great advances in our evolution have been precipitated by adjustments to our diets. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2010/08/02/128849908/food-for-thought-meat-based-diet-made-us-smarter" target="_blank">Our brains swelled</a> when we began eating meat 2.3 million years ago. Then, a million years later, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/cooking-up-bigger-brains/" target="_blank">our ability to cook food</a> gave rise to Homo erectus, our closest ancestor, who developed a digestive system 20 percent smaller and a brain 20 percent larger than his predecessors.</p>
<p>
	In the 1950s, Britain and America experimented with mind-altering technology for military gain. One of the CIA&rsquo;s most cartoonishly evil projects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra" target="_blank">MKUltra</a>, investigated the effects of psychotropic drugs, shock therapy, and hypnosis on participants, some willing and some not. Scientists attempted to make their subjects better at dealing with torture or more likely to tell the truth, and worked to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFBvQMCEJ7k" target="_blank">increase the efficiency of mentation and perception</a>.&rdquo; However, the science backfired, and the agency&rsquo;s attempts to control the human mind had remarkably counterproductive results.</p>
<p>
	Ken Kesey and Robert Hunter were two volunteers for the MKUltra experiment at Menlo Park Veterans Hospital, a mental health facility in California. Kesey spent time talking to the patients there and decided that they were socially marginalized rather than insane. His experiences inspired him to write the novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoos&#39; Nest</em>. Hunter would go on to join The Grateful Dead, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hunter_%28lyricist%29" target="_blank">it is said</a> that he was under the influence of the MKUltra experiments when he wrote the words to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSWfgpfN3qU&amp;feature=kp" target="_blank">China Cat Sunflower</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Both figures played a seminal role in arguably the biggest cultural movement of the 20th Century&mdash;one that endorsed the use of psychedelics for their ability to broaden horizons and produce a new kind of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144103/Jonny-Mellor-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 355px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em>Image by Jonny Mellor</em></p>
<p>
	Timothy Leary, a close friend of Kesey&#39;s, took a scientific approach to expanding consciousness. In 1964, he published <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, which laid out a practical framework for experimenting with hallucinogenic drugs. In Romania, in the same year, Giurgea published <em>The Fundamentals to the Pharmacology of the Mind</em>, in which he stated: &ldquo;Man is not going to wait passively for millions of years before evolution offers him a better brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In the eyes of the scientific community, Leary&rsquo;s passion for his subject transformed him from detached researcher to evangelist&mdash;the pervasive memory of him is of a guy who dropped acid with Allen Ginsberg and John Lennon; no one really remembers any meaningful data concerning the effects psychoactive drugs have on someone&rsquo;s brain. Giurgea&rsquo;s work, however, became a field of serious research.</p>
<p>
	Studies have repeatedly shown the practical benefits of nootropics, but their impact on society has been less explosive than Leary&rsquo;s work. This is, in part, because the effectiveness of nootropics <a href="http://www.purenootropics.net/alpha-brain-review-a-full-analysis/" target="_blank">is dependent</a> on an individual&rsquo;s neurochemistry, which is closely tied to weight, sleep patterns, and even mood, meaning the results of their use can vary hugely.</p>
<p>
	As Leary got older, his focus moved from drugs to technology. <a href="http://josephleech.co.uk/docs/The%20Internet%20causes%20depression.pdf" target="_blank">He proclaimed</a> that &ldquo;the PC is the LSD of the 90s&rdquo; and began what came to be known as the cyberpunk movement. Many adherents of the subculture went on to work in Silicon Valley, and it was from here that the Information Age unfolded.</p>
<p>
	In 2010, Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/12/04/the-human-face-of-big-data-a-great-coffee-table-book-of-an-unli/" target="_blank">said</a>: &ldquo;There were five exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every two days.&rdquo; The exact details of what he said were quickly proven to be incorrect, but we exist in a world of overwhelming information nevertheless. We are now expected to deal with an exorbitant amount of data endlessly streaming to us from every corner of our lives, and our natural response to this has been inadequate; we have no time to question fictions if they suit our worldview&mdash;the first paragraph of a Wikipedia page is as much knowledge as we need to get by.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
	Despite our natural ineptitude at managing this volume of data, we are increasingly treated like information processors in many aspects of life. Performance targets, efficiency ratings, and calculated margins of error have become the parameters we work within. In education, even the most abstract and non-prescriptive subjects are being reduced to an exercise in memorizing facts. And in attempts to plan and organize society, we are treated as predictable machines. Instead of Leary&rsquo;s vision that computers would liberate us, we are becoming the computers ourselves.</p>
<p>
	Wearable technology like Google Glass is the logical extension of this concept, minimizing the distinction between our devices and us. It keeps us fed with information and ensures we are never offline. But can we adapt to such an existence? Maybe nootropics can help us come full circle.</p>
<p>
	Smart drugs could be seen as the key to unlocking our full potential within the narrow confines of a society reliant on technology. In a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2451586/More-students-turning-cognitive-enhancing-drug-Modafinil-hope-boosting-grades-job-prospects.html" target="_blank"><em>Daily Mail</em> piece</a>, for example, a &ldquo;James,&rdquo; a Cambridge student, said that, when taking modafinil, &ldquo;Your brain worked more like a computer as it processed information.&rdquo; And although the government still doesn&rsquo;t quite know what to do with nootropics, John Harris thinks they could be fundamental to the future of education: &ldquo;They may even be provided to all students as a matter of course,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	The fact remains, however, that we are not information processors, and the human brain cannot be fully understood in terms of chemistry. Duke said: &ldquo;If we were just chemicals, how can one explain free will? Free will ignores the energy-defined constraints of chemistry.&rdquo; Ultimately, free will is more powerful than our chemical makeup. The brain plasticity that piracetam aids is consciously guided whenever we make a decision to learn a new language or to play an instrument.</p>
<p>
	So while smart drugs can provide an edge in a world where processing power is paramount, viewing them as a universal cure risks reducing humans to automatons. Duke says: &ldquo;The jury is still out on these drugs being evolutionary as opposed to de-evolutionary. How much are we guiding our brain to make connections that cannot be re-visited without the aid of the nootropics? We certainly don&#39;t know now, and I&#39;m not sure if we ever will.&rdquo; What he&rsquo;s saying is that if we start providing cognitive enhancers to children, we may be narrowing their future capabilities, prioritizing their functionality over their creativity and individuality.</p>
<p>
	William Gibson, another famous cyberpunk, <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/williamgib150472.html" target="_blank">once said</a>: &quot;Technologies are morally neutral until we apply them.&rdquo; Many noonauts are currently enhancing their lives with brain-boosting supplements, but if cognitive enhancers become normalized, which is more likely: that we become a society filled with intellectual experts, or that our increased capacity for work results in a larger workload?</p>
<p>
	Smartphones mean the office is always in our pocket. Smart drugs could mean the office is always in our minds. Which sounds like a really shitty place to end up.</p>

<title>The Basurero Is Burning: Life at the Gates of Hell in Guatemala City</title>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144284/Basurero-opener.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Guatemala City&#39;s massive dump as seen from above. All photos by author</i></p>
<p>
	In early January 2014, a fire broke out beneath the festering mountain of garbage that is Guatemala City&#39;s dump. The fire department half-heartedly tried to extinguish the inferno with water and suffocate it with bulldozers full of dirt, but it refused to go out, fueled by the chemical waste and toxic refuse deep below the surface of the trash pile. Seen from an airplane approaching the impoverished nation&#39;s airport, the acrid smoke billowing from the ugly gash in the center of the city looked like an open volcanic fault or the gates to hell.</p>
<p>
	Although the blaze on the surface of the trash heap was eventually extinguished and there are no open flames today, those who work in the dump say there are fires continuously burning deep within the trash pile, and while the firefighters continue to attempt to extinguish them, according to observers and residents they don&rsquo;t have the right equipment to completely extinguish the chemical-soaked piles. The fire technically only burned for two days in January, but I&#39;ve been told it smoldered within the garbage pile for a month before then.</p>
<p>
	Some 7,000 people work from dawn to dusk, 365 days a year in the dump&mdash;whole families spend their lives collecting plastic, metal, and old magazines from out of the trash heap to sell to recyclers. Around 1,000 of these <em>guajeros</em>, as the trash-pickers are called, are children, according to residents.</p>
<p>
	One elderly guajero told me he has worked in the <em>basurero </em>(Spanish for <em>dump</em>&mdash;it&rsquo;s also the name of the neighborhood where the guajeroslive) for 50 years, but in recent years there has been an influx of people coming here to join him. Many families have been driven to the basurero by poverty brought on by the global economic crisis coupled with mismanagement on the part of the Guatemalan government.</p>
<p>
	The work they do is incredibly dangerous, and the pay is terrible. At the end of the day, the guajeros go home across the street from the dump to a warren of garbage-choked alleyways and shacks made from corrugated metal and old tarpaulins. Because of the barrio&#39;s proximity to the dump, the air is always thick with the foul smoke of the garbage fires. Even at noon on an otherwise clear day, the sky over the basurero is white with thick smoke and dust.</p>
<p>
	There are no current estimates of the level of air contamination in the neighborhood, but a 2012 survey by the University of San Carlos found that the average annual amount of particulate contamination in the air at a testing station less than two miles from the dump was 94 micrograms per cubic meter of air. By comparison, the EPA recommends a <em>maximum</em> annual level of just 75 micrograms per cubic meter. In other parts of Guatemala City, air contamination averages around 45 micrograms per cubic meter, and even that seems dirty to most people from the US. Residents of the basurero complain of chronic congestion, constant headaches, and high rates of asthma and respiratory problems.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Our health is always worse,&rdquo; said Jos&eacute;, a local community leader, his eyes glassy and bloodshot. The only creatures that seem to thrive in the basurero are the thousands of vultures that constantly circle above the neighborhood.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>One of the alleyways where residents of the basurero live.</i></p>
<p>
	The danger to the guajeros and their families is not limited to dirty air. People die from accidents in the dump &ldquo;all the time,&rdquo; one worker told me. Many of the guajeros are addicted to crack or powder cocaine, and there&rsquo;s little in the way of formal authority. Portions of Zona 3, as the surrounding area is called, are reputedly under the de facto control of competing groups of narco traffickers, which can create a certain level of order and security, but the basurero itself is in a kind of no-man&#39;s land. &ldquo;The government controls nothing&rdquo; was how Jos&eacute; described it.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We asked for medical help, it didn&#39;t happen. We asked for security, it didn&#39;t happen. We asked for ambulances, it didn&#39;t happen,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; told me. He said that although there&rsquo;s a clinic with doctors who visit regularly, there&rsquo;s never any medicine there, and added that the community&#39;s single greatest need is new roofs for their huts.</p>
<p>
	Many adults working in the basurero cannot read or write, including Jose, and most families are illegally squatting on the land they live on, but the grimmest thing about the current situation in the slum is that for many of the people who came to the neighborhood from the countryside, moving here was supposed to be a step up from their former lives.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Most of them have no school or very little school, maybe some elementary,&rdquo; said Andrea Marroqu&iacute;n, the head of PR for <a href="http://www.safepassage.org/" target="_blank">Camino Seguro</a> (&quot;Safe Passage&quot;), an NGO that works to provide education to children of guajeros. &ldquo;They&#39;re looking for new opportunities here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The last major migration to the basurero occurred in 2009, shortly after the world financial meltdown. The crash came at the beginning of a process of land consolidation by the sugar plantations, and many poor people who had previously been tenant farmers found their livelihoods swallowed up in land deals. Moreover, those from the south of Guatemala generally have fewer relatives living in the United States, and so received less money from family members working abroad compared to the rest of the country.</p>
<p>
	Direct investment in Guatemala dropped 20 percent between 2008 and 2009 (it recovered the following year), and the bottom fell out of the economy. At the same time, the price of basic commodities began to skyrocket&mdash;the cost of providing food for a family in Guatemala grew 50 percent from 2007 to 2011. The construction jobs that many poor people had relied on disappeared, and remittances sent to Guatemalans from friends and relatives abroad plunged 10 percent from 2008 to 2009. Guatemala&#39;s rate of GPD growth dropped from 6.3 percent in 2007 to a low of just 0.5 percent in 2009. By then, the entire world was suffering the effects of a recession, and poor Guatemalans were hit especially hard.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;In 2009 and 2010, the economy was very slow, and these people probably rely on day-to-day labor,&rdquo; said Araceli Martinez, an anthropologist at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. &ldquo;What they have left is the city, and where in the city? The slums.&rdquo; Once they arrived in the basurero, recent migrants found themselves without skills and community networks they had previously relied upon to get work. Migrants tended to cluster together with others from the same town or region, further reducing their ability to access labor markets in Guatemala City. As a result, the only work they can find is picking through the dump&rsquo;s immense mounds of garbage.</p>
<p>
	For those who have moved to the basurero, the work is a way &ldquo;to live the day,&rdquo; Andrea said. &ldquo;It&#39;s all about perspective. They don&#39;t see the health problems, and for them [trash picking is] an income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Yet once people arrive in the basurero, they rarely find a better life. Lacking an education and never earning enough money to save a nest egg, families get stuck in the slums, where they don&rsquo;t have access to the city&rsquo;s social services.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Even if you move from a beautiful, clean town in the country&hellip; the perception is that moving to the city, even to a slum, is moving up,&rdquo; Araceli said. &ldquo;But it&#39;s only an illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	It falls to private charitable organizations to provide basic services in the neighborhood. Camino Seguro tries to help by providing education to children and food to families in addition to adult tutoring, but it doesn&rsquo;t have nearly enough resources. &ldquo;After they finish school they come here&hellip; we try to keep them in a safe space,&rdquo; Andrea said. The children receive tutoring, regular checkups, and meals. &ldquo;None of our kids have malnutrition,&rdquo; Andrea told me, &ldquo;and that&#39;s a success for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144287/Basurero-men.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 540px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Men rest outside the walls of the dump.</i></p>
<p>
	Guatemala City&#39;s notorious street gangs, the <em>maras</em>, have far more power than NGOs n the basurero. On a good day, a guajero earns around 40 Quetzales ($5). However, the gangs regularly extort the workers for about half of their daily earnings, often leaving them with as little as $2.50 for an entire day of back-breaking labor.</p>
<p>
	The maras also prey on unattended children, recruiting them into extortion schemes and other illegal activities. &ldquo;This is a red zone,&rdquo; said Andrea. &ldquo;It&#39;s called a red zone because there is a lot of crime down here and gangs. And so, if you live in another zone, you don&#39;t want to come here for anything.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;A lot of people know what&#39;s going on&hellip; but there are more who just don&#39;t have any idea,&rdquo; she added. In general, people simply try to avoid getting in trouble, and &ldquo;even when they know what&#39;s going on, they don&#39;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The police have a presence here, but they do little to maintain order or protect the community. Rape, theft, and child abuse are extremely common, according to people in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;The police are bandits,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; told me when I visited him. He pointed to a patch of dirt near a dingy <em>tienda </em>selling chips and soft drinks. &ldquo;A man was killed right there,&rdquo; he told me. Police officers with shotguns stood barely 50 yards away. &ldquo;They did nothing,&rdquo; Jos&eacute; said, indicating the cops.</p>
<p>
	The officers stationed at the enormous green gates of the basurero are ostensibly there to prevent unlicensed workers and children from entering the dump&mdash;they have clipboards with lists of ID numbers&mdash;but large gaps in the wall and the thundering parade of garbage trucks allow guajeros to sneak in and out relatively unhindered.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;There are no records of how many people work there,&rdquo; Andrea said. &ldquo;We have had reports of kids still working there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144289/Basurero-children.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 822px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Children inside the door of one of the basurero&#39;s shacks.</i></p>
<p>
	When I visited the dump in an attempt to document conditions there, I was turned away at the gate by police and told I couldn&rsquo;t take pictures without a special permit from the city&mdash;a predictable result given the way the authorities have stopped information about the basurero from getting out.</p>
<p>
	Guatemala&#39;s press has largely failed to cover the humanitarian crisis in the neighborhood. What coverage there has been focused on the efforts of the fire department to control the blazes that periodically break out there&mdash;and reports do not mention, as Jos&eacute; did, that the fire smoldered for a month prior to the arrival of the fire department. There&rsquo;s very little attention being paid to the ugly conditions of day-to-day life in the basurero. Jos&eacute; believes that &ldquo;the government pays journalists not to write about the dump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In any case, it wasn&rsquo;t very difficult to dodge the police at the gates. I was able to photograph the gates of the dump from a moving car, and the city&#39;s public cemetery is perched precariously above the cliff wall of the dump&mdash;the vast hell-scape can be hazily seen through the smoke.</p>
<p>
	The public cemetery is where the vultures perch in between dives into the pit. It&rsquo;s a massive city of mausoleums where families rent shelves for the bones of their ancestors. In the past, if a family failed to make the annual $25 payment to the cemetery, the bones of their relative would be exhumed by the graveyard&rsquo;s management, and, according to some, chucked off the edge into the dump.</p>
<p>
	When I was there leaning out over the edge taking photos, I saw a relatively new SUV with &ldquo;Social Services&rdquo; blazoned on its side was parked at the cemetery gate. Vans like that are relatively common all over the city, but not in the basurero. Even the dead have better access to services than those laboring in the dump below. The scale of the dump is immense, and the pit is surrounded on all sides by cliffs, creating a suffocating, enclosed feeling. The effect is of a fetid mass grave, and the guajeros lurching from garbage pile to garbage pile look like the living dead.</p>

	Troubled by its country&rsquo;s notorious reputation for civil unrest and terrorism, Yemen&rsquo;s capital, Sanaa, has been fighting a losing battle to preserve its architectural history. With over 6,500 inhabited buildings more than three times the age of the United States, Sanaa&rsquo;s Old City district is among UNESCO&rsquo;s most remarkable <a href="http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/sanaa.html">World Heritage Sites</a>. This labyrinth of mud-brick markets, gardens, and homes is elaborately adorned with distinctive, white-plaster designs that wrap and decorate its exterior. However, while tourism has plummeted in recent years, the job of maintaining Sanaa&rsquo;s heritage continues in the same surprisingly perilous manner as it has since the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>
	Each year Arabian dust storms erode the Old City&rsquo;s plasterwork, and painters go to work restoring its artistic charm. Across the skyline painters descend from the rooftops, balancing themselves on narrow wooden platforms that are suspended only by a single rope. Unlike modern window washers, the painters&rsquo; work is characterized by centuries of tradition. That means laboring without harnesses or safety equipment on buildings reaching ten stories high.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><em>A building that recently collapsed because of leaky plumbing and poor maintenance</em></span></p>
<p>
	Their pulley system, which is powered sustainably by manual labor, can have its drawbacks. And so painters often find themselves hanging halfway down a building&rsquo;s exterior when the time comes for Islamic prayer. Because of the team&rsquo;s limited lifting abilities, the painters can only be lowered downward, not hoisted up. This leaves the painters with only one way of getting back to the top: Relying solely on their sheer strength, they climb the rope hand over hand, walking up the side of the building.</p>
<p>
	And the whole time, they&rsquo;re high on khat&mdash;a slightly euphoric leafy green plant that is ingested like chewing tobacco. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re painting you have to be strong, and when I chew I can do the work perfectly,&rdquo; said Mohammed al Seeani. At the age of 65, Mohammed has 40 years of painting under his belt, making him one of the most experienced and respected painters in Yemen.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I used to carry water from the well when I was young, and I noticed a painting crew mixing water and gypsum nearby,&rdquo; Mohammed remembered. Curious about their work, he approached the men who began to teach him about their craft. &ldquo;Then one day there was a well that was very deep, 65 meters (about 200 feet). It had been clogged by dirt, and they needed to remove it in order to get the water underneath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
	<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">Mohammed making his way from the stable rooftop to his wobbly platform</span></em></p>
<p>
	Rappelling into these dim and claustrophobic well shafts is a right of passage for aspiring painters and considered a test of a candidate&rsquo;s mental readiness. &ldquo;They took the rope, and if it&#39;s your first time, they put it around your stomach,&rdquo; Mohammed said. He had once known a man that was well diving when the rope snapped, plunging the man into the darkness below. Fortunately, Mohammed resurfaced unscathed and self-assured. &ldquo;After the well incident I knew I wanted to paint the houses,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>
	Nowadays the painters&rsquo; work has become increasingly hazardous due to the rapid deterioration of the Old City&rsquo;s buildings. In fact, more than 400 homes throughout the Heritage Site have collapsed due to <a href="http://www.yementimes.com/en/1652/news/2020/Building-violations-on-the-rise-in-the-Old-City.htm">new construction and the installation</a> of water piping in these 11th century dwellings. Over the years, leaky plumbing has gradually eroded the buildings from the inside out while poor drainage has softened the roofs the painters work on. &ldquo;One time in my work, there were three ceiling beams that fell from above and hit my son, but he was OK and was working a month and a half later,&rdquo; Mohammed recalled.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144218/sanaa-belay-khat.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<em><span style="font-size: 12px;">A Yemeni teen is charged with the responsibility of belaying the rope that supports both Mohammed and his platform.</span></em></p>
<p>
	The neglected state of the Old City prompted UNESCO to consider revoking Sanaa&rsquo;s World Heritage Site status last spring. According to Mohammed, financial support from UNESCO spurred the government to call up painters from around the country in an effort to maintain its UN designation. A mobilization of this scale had only happened once previously in 2004, when the government (again with UNESCO funding) employed 140 painters to repaint all of the Old City.</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;All of us painters are friends,&rdquo; said Mohammed. &ldquo;When the government rehires them all, all of them will come. Just one phone call, and all of them will be in Sanaa.&rdquo; Until then, Mohammed continues to train his teenage son, passing the age-old techniques on to the next generation.</p>

<title>Seattle Has a Haunted Soda Machine</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144230/coke-machine.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>Definitely haunted. All photos by Jon Manning.</i></p>
<p class="p1">
	As about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/02/real-ghosts-americans-poll_n_2049485.html"><span class="s1">45 percent of us know</span></a>, ghosts are <i>definitely</i> real and casually walk among us. Some have a post-life agenda of stealing our socks or manifesting as apparitions on burned toast; others prefer to spend their time banging around abandoned children&rsquo;s hospitals for Syfy Channel reality shows. But there&rsquo;s one ghost who has taken an industrious approach, choosing to operate a creepy Coca-Cola machine on an innocuous corner in Seattle&rsquo;s Capitol Hill. Like an endless <i>Encyclopedia Brown </i>story, the machine has been an ongoing source of curiosity and fear from locals for decades due to its weird location, outdated appearance, and reputation for being continuously and strangely stocked by a seemingly non-existent operator. It brings to mind the famous line from <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory </i>that gave entire generations of children the heebie jeebies: &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLi-ellge1s"><span class="s1">Nobody ever goes in, and nobody ever comes out</span></a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p2">
	With its sun-bleached buttons and charmingly antiquated Mountain Dew logo, the Mystery Coke Machine has been spitting out sodas on the corner of John and Broadway for upwards of 15 years, but no one seems to know exactly for how long&mdash;or who re-stocks, maintains, or collects money from the thing. It&rsquo;s as though it fell out of a wormhole and landed free-standing onto this lonely corner. From the get-go, its 70s appearance evoked a sense of cheery yet ominous nostalgia, as if Matthew McConaughey&rsquo;s character from <i>Dazed and Confused</i> would fit right in with it, leaning against its side while he&rsquo;s busy winking at you. Prior to encountering it, you may not consider how unusual and even intimidating a vending machine looks standing alone on a sidewalk. It&rsquo;s almost as though it&rsquo;s forever waiting for something, or someone in particular, to show up.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Unlike its contemporaries that are characteristically flanked with buttons down their <a href="http://www.jaavending.com/images/soda-vending-machines-coca-cola-nj-ny.jpg"><span class="s1">right-hand-side</span></a>, its offerings are presented in horizontal rows at eye level. And here comes the creepy kicker: it has the standard offerings&mdash;cola, root beer, &ldquo;Dew&rdquo;&mdash;but also a whimsical, circusy-looking, fear-of-clowns-conjuring &ldquo;? Mystery ?&rdquo; button that results in a random selection. And that doesn&rsquo;t mean a random selection from the other drink choices; it means beverages so random that you couldn&rsquo;t even think of them if you were playing Scattegories. Upon recently bestowing the machine with three dollars, I received a Mountain Dew White Out, a raspberry-flavored Nestea Brisk, a Hawaiian Punch, and a Grape Fanta. It has also been rumored to birth Vanilla Cokes, Black Cherry Frescas, and Sunkist Cherry Limeade, among many other libationary oddities.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144236/mystery-button-combined.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 258px;" /></p>
<p class="p2">
	Seeking answers, I looked to Broadway Locksmith, the establishment nearest to the machine. Merely a patch of grass and a handicap ramp away, I felt certain that they must have seen <i>someone</i> enacting some evidence of responsibility over the MCM, but they either genuinely have no clue or are feigning ignorance. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve honestly never seen anyone open it,&rdquo; offers Mickey, the locksmith business&rsquo;s earnest-sounding general manager. &ldquo;Do people get soda out of it frequently?&rdquo; I ask him &ldquo;Oh yeah, all the time. All day long,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; And yet in a decade-and-a-half, you&rsquo;ve never seen anyone tampering with it or refilling it?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; he shrugged, &ldquo;He must come in the middle of the night on a weekend or something.&rdquo; Or, as our theory states, the soda emissary could be a restless, undead spirit able to transcend the laws of space-time in order to supply an endless assortment of carbonated drinks.</p>
<p class="p2">
	Unconvinced that Mickey and his locksmith mignions had nothing to do with the machine, I pressed him for knowledge. &ldquo;Are you sure that you&rsquo;re not the one who collects money out of it?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;I think they run on the same power as our address, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; Mickey also claims that people often gather around the machine to stare at it with frightened wonder, or put entire rolls of quarters into its bowels in hopes of decoding its mystery-button logic. Where can you even get Brisk iced tea in a can anymore? Supposing that the operator of this mystifying appliance is a flesh-and-blood human being, it&rsquo;s truly admirable that he or she could evade the eye of the masses for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Or perhaps the operator of the machine isn&rsquo;t the ghost, but the machine itself. Where can we go anymore to receive something spontaneous &nbsp;and unexpected, rather than painfully customized, curated, tailor-marketed, and tech&rsquo;d to death? Coke&rsquo;s newest vending machine model, dubbed &ldquo;<a href="https://www.coca-colafreestyle.com/"><span class="s1">The Coca-Cola Freestyle</span></a>,&rdquo; claims to offer more than 100 quote-unquote made-to-order beverage choices, ranging from Caffeine-Free Diet Coke to Seagram&rsquo;s Cherry Ginger Ale to Powerade Zero Fruit Punch, even boasting an integrative app that allows you to find the nearest location, save your <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=suicide%20(drink)"><span class="s1">digital suicides</span></a>, and check in to earn &ldquo;badges.&rdquo; But all of this for soda personalization? Does this seem preferable to stumbling upon an aged vending machine on an unexpected curb and letting the powers that be choose your beverage fate? Surely, there is something to be said for the spirit of a good old-fashioned gamble&mdash;at least if the people of Seattle have anything to say about it, as they prostrate to the boxy idol with their loose change year upon passing year. Like a forgotten love song on the radio, an aluminum vial of Hawaiian Punch could never carry quite the same weight unless bestowed upon you by chance.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	But one notable amendment is that the price of the sodas in the mystery machine recently rose from 55 to 75 cents.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
	Looks like even ghosts aren&rsquo;t exempt from inflation.&nbsp;</p>

	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144184/b2e80c5dc08ccda3-spooklight-road4.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 512px;" /></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<a href="http://larashipley.com/">Lara Shipley</a> is a Lawrence, Kansas&ndash;based photographer who follows a mythical glowing orb of light through the back roads of rural southern Missouri with her collaborator, <a href="http://antonedolezal.com/">Antone Dolezal</a>. These pictures are available in an ongoing series of artist publications from <a href="http://searchpartypress.com/">Search Party Press</a>, titled <em>The Spook Light Chronicles</em>. For her series <em>Coming, Going, Staying</em>, Lara brings this vision to more concrete material of people and objects in the transient border towns of southern Arizona. Clearly, this photographer is interested in ethereal subjects that do not stay put. We spoke with her about the mysterious &quot;spook light,&quot; the nature of documentation, and how she revels in the ambiguity between the tangible and the fantastic.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Mossless: Where did you grow up?</strong></div>
<div>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Lara Shipley: </strong>I&rsquo;m from a teeny town in the Ozark region of Missouri.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>You shot your series <em>Devil&rsquo;s Promenade</em>&nbsp;together with Antone Dolezal. The subject of the series is the &quot;spook light&quot; in the Missouri Ozarks. What is the &quot;spook light,&quot; and how long has it been around?</strong></div>
<div>
	The &quot;spook light&quot; is an orb of light that is said to appear on a rural road in southern Missouri. Sightings of it go back over a hundred years, and the earliest photograph I&rsquo;ve seen is from the turn of the 20th century. There are many stories to explain the &quot;spook light,&quot; which do more to reveal the history of the region and the mixing of European and Native American cultures that happened here. Symbolically, as a light in the darkness it has a redemptive force for this community located in the Bible Belt. Yet it is said the Devil also lives there, ready to steal a wandering soul. Like a moth to a flame it has attracted a number of eccentrics over the years, many of whom also become a part of the local mythology. The folklore, passed on through generations of families, shapes and contains the community living in the midst of the light. I believe this shared mythology is more important to the local community than what the light really is and whether or not it actually exists.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Did you approach to <em>Devil&rsquo;s Promenade</em>&nbsp;in a similar way to your other seires, <em>Coming, Going, Staying</em>?</strong></div>
<div>
	For <em>Coming, Going and Staying</em>&nbsp;and <em>Devil&rsquo;s Promenade</em>, my focus is on small rural communities, the pain and pleasures of isolated living today, and how contained places develop their own cultural identities. In both projects I am interested in how local people respond to the unseen or unexplained in their community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<em>Coming, Going and Staying</em>&nbsp;takes place in a town located in the borderlands of southern Arizona. There is large-scale migration happening in the desert surrounding town, visible mainly in the detritus left behind, such as a sleeping bag or a jug of water. My approach was to mix portraits of the local people with this difficult landscape and signs of the invisible movement within it. With <em>Devil&rsquo;s Promenad</em>e we were working with material that is more abstract. I see the searching for the spook light as a desire for the transcendent experience as an anecdote for the banality of life. For this subject it made sense to include images made in both straight and staged styles. Our project is not concerned with documenting this phenomenon but rather revels in this ambiguity between the tangible and the fantastic, the insertion of the mythical within a familiar world.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144194/0309b193e6b1fe5d-staying05.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>You&#39;ve said that you like to adjust the surroundings of your subjects, which isn&#39;t typical for documentary work. What effect does it have?</strong></div>
<div>
	I don&rsquo;t consider myself a documentary photographer. I am a storyteller who is striving to find the best visuals to describe my perspective on my experiences. Portrait making for me is about using the body and the surroundings to invite a narrative, not to describe a situation as it actually is. I believe as an outsider it would be arrogant for me to suggest that was even possible. The effect is that the portrait is a mixture of my subject and myself. I am the narrator, the unseen presence in all of my images. I feel this to be the case with all portrait makers and am in dialogue with a long line of artists who position their subjects and alter surroundings (such as Dorothea Lange and Alec Soth), but I would like my role to be explicit. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Do you feel it sets your subjects outside of their personal realities?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	The simple act of making a portrait is going to set a subject out of their realities. All portraits are a performance for the camera. I want my subject to have some control over how they are perceived (I never costume), and I strive to make an image that reflects the version of themselves they offer to me. But people are extremely complex, more complex than a portrait can contain. I wear makeup every day. Would a &ldquo;real&rdquo; image of me be one with or without this mask? I&rsquo;m not sure, but for me what is more interesting is this malleable fantasy we create about ourselves and other people rather than the raw God-given material that is our bodies or the mess of our untended surroundings.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144209/1af3772760d911c5-staying07.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>Can you tell us some stories of the people you&rsquo;ve met and photographed along the way?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
	One of my portraits from the series <em>Coming, Going and Staying</em>&nbsp;is of Angel, a woman in her late teens living in a small town near the border. I spent an afternoon with her talking about her life and making pictures. She was surprised that I would find her home interesting, because it was so small and, for her, old news. She had graduated from high school a year or so before and had been working a series of odd jobs since, hanging out with a group who had also stuck around and were usually unemployed. That morning she had quit her job at the Dollar General, where she&#39;d developed carpal tunnel from working the cash register. She talked a lot about leaving town, but she talked even more about a young veteran and rodeo rider with whom she was falling in love. I decided to photograph her in her car because her seats were covered in the hearts that seemed to float around her head. However, a car is a means of escape if you choose to use it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	<strong>What&rsquo;s life like so close to the border?</strong></div>
<div>
	In my experience, the places where I spent time while working on this project were not unlike the small town where I grew up in the Midwest. The effort to maintain a sense of community in the face of limited economic opportunity seems to characterize American rural living today and isn&#39;t subject to geographical differences. I met people who would be lost without the safety net of a tight-knit community, those whose isolationist tendencies require wide-open spaces, and others who are stifled by the sameness and the lack of resources but don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t leave. All of these people felt very familiar despite living in a landscape that for me was initially very exotic. When beginning this project I was surprised by this familiarity because of all the ways the border is so unique. But I found that for locals the presence of checkpoints outside of town, temporarily stationed border patrol in the cafes, circling helicopters, and the newspaper articles detailing the large quantity of drugs and migrants found dead or alive in the surrounding desert had become background noise to their small-town life.&nbsp;</div>

<title>Bad Cop Blotter: Hawaii Cops Say They Need to Be Allowed to Sleep With Prostitutes, Just in Case</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/hawaii-cops-say-they-need-to-be-allowed-to-sleep-with-prostitutes-just-in-case</link>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144267/hawaii-cops.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
	<i>We probably can&#39;t say that cops in Honolulu want to have sex with prostitutes, but they definitely want to be able to have sex with prostitutes, at least. Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sfyoshi/" target="_blank">yoshinari</a></i></p>
<p>
	Cops usually can&rsquo;t break the law, even when they&rsquo;re undercover, but police departments in Hawaii recently lobbied state lawmakers to carve out an exception to what is a pretty good rule. Last week, when the state legislature was considering amending an anti-prostitution law to prohibit undercover officers from having penetrative sex with prostitutes, the police were like, &ldquo;Actually, we need the flexibility to have full-on intercourse or we can&rsquo;t do our jobs properly. Third base doesn&rsquo;t cut it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	Hawaii&rsquo;s House passed the bill, thereby saying &ldquo;you can have sex with prostitutes if you <em>really</em> need to,&rdquo; but, understandably, a week&rsquo;s worth of headlines like &ldquo;Hawaiian Police Want to Have Sex with Prostitutes Real Bad&rdquo; and &ldquo;Haha Dude Wasn&rsquo;t This Exact Thing in <em>The Wire</em>?&rdquo; caused <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-hawaii-police-prostitution-20140321,0,1909799.story#axzz2wuNCUtJG" target="_blank">legislators to have second thoughts about the rule</a> now that it&rsquo;s hit the state Senate.</p>
<p>
	Sex trafficking victims&#39; advocacy groups are horrified by the prospect of the cops having sex with people who are being forced to perform these acts, and <a href="http://www.kitv.com/news/undercover-police-practice-of-sex-with-prostitutes-comes-under-fire/25085138" target="_blank">some former sex workers</a> dispute the frequency of &ldquo;cop checks,&rdquo; in which suspicious prostitutes start performing sex acts to determine whether their john is really an undercover officer. But Honolulu cop Jerry Inouye argued to the state House judiciary committee that the police need this statue in place just so that pimps and sex workers <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/hawaii-law-lets-police-sex-prostitutes-22997456" target="_blank">don&rsquo;t <em>know </em>cops are barred</a> from sleeping with prostitutes while on duty. The Honolulu Police Department&rsquo;s written statement likewise pleaded that not letting cops engage in full-on sex would be &ldquo;preventing officers from enforcing prostitution laws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	On the other hand, <a href="http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/histatutes/5/37/712/I/712-1200" target="_blank">technically just agreeing to participate</a> in a sex act for money counts as prostitution in the state of Hawaii. It seems like it would be easy for cops to bring someone in without having to, y&rsquo;know, do it. And, <a href="http://m.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/03/21/about-that-law-letting-police-in-hawaii-have-sex-with-prostitutes/?wpisrc=nl_headlines" target="_blank">according to the <em>Washington Post</em></a>, prostitution&mdash;a petty misdemeanor&mdash;made up a whopping 0.7 percent of the arrests in Honolulu in 2012. It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a priority for their officers, so why exactly is this right to unrestricted sexy time with sex workers so important? And why does the rest of America seem to be doing fine without such a law?</p>
<p>
	It&rsquo;s almost as if Hawaii cops just really, really want to believe that having sex with a woman, then arresting the woman for accepting payment, is a vital part of their jobs.</p>
<p>
	Now on to the rest of the week&rsquo;s bad cops:</p>
<p>
	&ndash;On Friday, the city of Oakland, California, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/4-5M-settlement-for-Oakland-protester-wounded-by-5337743.php" target="_blank">agreed to pay $4.5 million dollars</a> to Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen, who suffered a skull fracture and a traumatic brain injury during an Occupy Oakland protest on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/26/scott-olsen-occupy-oakland-review" target="_blank">October 25, 2011</a>. Olsen was hit in the head by a beanbag round fired by police, and Officer Robert Roche threw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So7Y1FK2BiE" target="_blank">a tear-gas canister</a> at a group who rushed to aid him as he lay on the ground. Olsen was unable to speak for some time after the incident, and he says he still has memory loss. According to the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, Roche has been involved in three fatal shootings in his career, and he is currently fighting agaist the city&rsquo;s effort to fire him over the Olsen incident. The city paid out $1.17 million to a dozen other protesters who said police engaged in excessive force that same day.</p>
<p>
	&ndash;On December 6, 23-year-old Cameron Redus was fatally shot after drunk-driving home to his apartment in San Antonio, Texas. The shooter was Christopher Carter, a campus police officer at the University of the Incarnate Word, where Redus was enrolled. Redus&mdash;who had a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit and was driving erratically&mdash;was reported by witnesses to have sarcastically said, &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re gonna shoot me?&rdquo; moments before Carter did so five times in the left eye, the upper chest, the back, the left elbow, and the right hip. <a href="http://www.kens5.com/news/BREAKING-Bexar-Co-Medical-Examiner-releases-autopsy-of-slain-UIW-student-251225231.html" target="_blank">An autopsy confirmed this week</a> that the back shot, which was fired at extremely close range, killed the student. Carter was wearing a microphone on his uniform, which <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/03/21/autopsy-shows-texas-cop-fired-fatal-shot-from-close-range-into-sarcastic-students-back/#.Uyxez7308Oc.facebook" target="_blank">recorded Carter telling Redus</a> to put his hands behind his back 14 times, and to stop resisting 56 times. Carter also said that Redus hit him with his own baton. Carter got his baton back, then shot Redus when he charged at him, but the dashcam in Carter&#39;s cruiser didn&#39;t record the encounter, so it&#39;s difficult to sort out what happened. Carter remains on administrative leave, and some questions have yet to be answered, namely: Why do campus cops need guns again?</p>
<p>
	&ndash;According to the Associated Press, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/police-phone-tracking-contracts-often-kept-secret-154542600--politics.html" target="_blank">police may be using a cellphone tracking device called a Stingray</a> a lot more often than anyone realizes. The Stingray is a small gizmo that tricks phones into thinking it&rsquo;s a cell tower, allowing police to intercept information from phones. That&#39;s all I can tell you. How exactly it works, which departments have used it, and how often, is mostly a giant question mark, because cops are not interested in spilling that secret. Neither is the Stingray&rsquo;s manufacturer, Harris Corp., which signs private contracts with police departments. We don&rsquo;t even know what rules the cops follow when they use these things, which is arguably a problem.</p>
<p>
	&ndash;On February 22, four National Forest Service officers (reportedly clad in SWAT gear) <a href="http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/official-taos-ski-valley-raid-not-result-of-ticket-quota/25045368" target="_blank">arrived at a ski resort in Taos, New Mexico</a>, to issue citations for marijuana use, reckless driving, and even cracked windshields. The so-called &ldquo;saturation patrol&rdquo; even searched cars and people, making many uncomfortable in the name of &ldquo;safety.&rdquo; Saturation patrols are <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/03/20/jack-booted-thugs-what-four-new-mexico-forest-officers-did-at-a-taos-ski-resort-is-facing-harsh-backlash/" target="_blank">normally deployed</a> to areas known for drinking or drug use&mdash;the object is ostensibly to prevent impaired driving, though obviously the tactic can be pretty invasive in many cases. Now former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson (who ran for president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2012) is full of righteous anger about the incident&mdash;he even used the term &ldquo;jackbooted thugs&rdquo; in an interview with a local TV station. The Forest Service says it is reviewing the procedure and making sure everything was proper. I&rsquo;m sure everything was in accordance with various guidelines&mdash;which doesn&rsquo;t mean those guidelines shouldn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>
	&ndash;Back in May of 2013, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-aclu-sue-la-law-enforcement-agencies-over-license-plate-reader-records" target="_blank">the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit</a><u> </u>asking for Automatic License Plate Reader (ALPR) data from the LA County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department and the LAPD. These two agencies have been jealously guarding most of the the details of their data collection operation, including whom they share data with and exactly what a week&rsquo;s worth of it looks like. Scanning license plates seems like a relatively minor thing for the police to do, but in the words of an EFF lawyer, it allows the police to track &ldquo;where you work and live, what doctor you go to, which religious services you attend, and who your friends are.&rdquo; <a href="http://gizmodo.com/los-angeles-cops-argue-all-cars-in-l-a-are-under-inves-1547411605/all" target="_blank">In response to the lawsuit</a>, lawyers representing the LA County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department and the LAPD filed a brief that argued all of the data is &ldquo;investigatory&rdquo; in nature, meaning it is exempt from the relevant public records statute&mdash;that&#39;s the case even when the data in question is for license plates of ordinary people who haven&#39;t been accused of any crime. The lawsuit is ongoing, with EFF filing a response brief on March 14, which disputed the law enforcement organizations&rsquo; definition of &ldquo;investigatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ndash;Our Good Cop of the Week is <a href="http://www.wicz.com/news2005/viewarticle.asp?a=32336">the sheriff&#39;s deputy</a> in Broome County, New York,&nbsp;who saved a woman from a heroin overdose with the much-touted wonder drug naloxone. On Thursday, March 20, Sergeant Thomas Williams took a call from a woman who said her daughter was unconscious. When he arrived at the home, Williams administered the drug, and then took the woman to the hospital. Our <em>other</em> Good Cop of the Week is Williams&rsquo;s boss, Sheriff David Harder, who <a href="http://northernny.twcnews.com/content/news/716813/broome-county-fights-heroin-epidemic-through-medicine/" target="_blank">just a month ago announced</a> that all his deputies would begin carrying the drug in order to up the chances of survival for people who overdose. That&rsquo;s how you save lives, Sheriff. Good job.</p>

<title>American Jails Are Wretched Hell Holes for the Mentally Ill</title>

<p>
	In the latest gruesome dispatch from the clusterfuck that is America&#39;s corrections system,&nbsp;<a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-nyc-inmate-baked-death-cell">the Associated Press reported</a>&nbsp;last week that Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill former Marine, &ldquo;basically baked to death&rdquo; in his 6&#39;-by-10&#39; cinderblock cell in Rikers Island. According to the AP, Murdough, who was homeless and on anti-psychotropic and anti-seizure medication, had been at Rikers for about a week, after being picked up by police in February on a misdemeanor trespassing charge for sleeping on the roof of a Harlem housing project. On the night he died, Murdough had complained of being overheated. Because he was housed in a special unit for mentally ill inmates, officers were supposed to check on his cell every 15 minutes, but instead he was ignored and left alone. When his cell was finally opened, four hours later, Murdough was already dead, and his internal body temperature and the temperature in his cell were at least 100 degrees.</p>
<p>
	The incident is horrifying, but also perhaps unsurprising, given the grim&mdash;and often deadly&mdash;conditions for mentally ill inmates at big urban jails like Rikers Island. The number of mentally ill people housed in American prisons and jails has &ldquo;skyrocketed&rdquo; over the past few decades, said Bandy Lee, a professor of psychology at Yale University who specializes in violence at prisons and jails. Murdough&rsquo;s death, Lee said, &ldquo;is actually a natural consequence&rdquo; of putting mentally ill inmates in facilities that are neither designed nor equipped to deal with them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s evidence of the level of ignorance that corrections officers have of the mentally ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	In a statement, New York City&#39;s acting correction commissioner Mark Cranston said that the department is conducting a &quot;full investigation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Murdough&#39;s unfortunate death, including issues of staff performance and the adequacy of procedures.&quot; While the cause of death is still under investigation, Cranston did confirm in his statement that there were &quot;unusually high temperatures&quot; in Murdough&#39;s cell, and said that &quot;remedial action&quot; has been taken to resolve mechanical issues in the immediate facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But the problems at Rikers Island extend beyond faulty temperature control. On Monday, federal agents announced that they had <a href="http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys/pressreleases/March14/TerrencePendergrassPRComplaintPR.php">arrested and charged a New York City corrections officer</a>&nbsp;with &quot;deliberate indifference&quot; in the death of a mentally ill inmate who ate a toxic soap ball and then pounded on his cell door for hours begging for medical help.</p>
<p>
	As Lee and other experts and prisoners&#39;-rights advocates have noted, both deaths underscore the challenges city jails face in dealing with growing populations of mentally ill prisoners. At Rikers, the proportion of inmates with a diagnosed mental illness has jumped to 40 percent, up from 20 percent just eight years ago, according to the Department of Corrections. Jails are neither designed nor equipped to be mental institutions and, unsurprisingly, locking up people who are in need of psychiatric care has resulted in mayhem. A&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/nyregion/rise-in-mental-illness-and-violence-at-vast-jail-on-rikers-island.html?smid=pl-share">New York Times </a></em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/nyregion/rise-in-mental-illness-and-violence-at-vast-jail-on-rikers-island.html?smid=pl-share">investigation</a> into conditions at Rikers Island, published just one day before Murdough&rsquo;s death was reported, found that at least 12 inmates have been slashed or stabbed since New Year&#39;s Eve. According to internal reports obtained by the <em>Times</em>, inmates and corrections officers have suffered lacerations, concussions, punctured eardrums, and fractures to noses, eye sockets, jaws, and hips. The investigation found that in the past ten years, the use of force by corrections officers has jumped 240 percent, even as the Rikers population has declined 15 percent.</p>
<p>
	The <em>Times</em> report notes that officers are also regularly abused by inmates&mdash;in one incident this month, an officer was stabbed in the face with a pen. According to the Corrections Department, mentally ill prisoners are responsible for about two-thirds of infractions at New York City jails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;With that number of people who are mentally vulnerable in very stressful situations, of course there is going to be more disruptive behavior and escalation of violence,&rdquo; Lee said. &quot;Corrections officers are trained to respond with punitive measures or more violence, expecting that individuals will be in control of their behavior. But of course, with the mentally ill, for most of them there is a high probability that they won&#39;t be. Rather than follow rules and behavioral guidelines, they will act even more unpredictably. And the corrections officers panic and respond with more violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The chaos isn&rsquo;t limited to Rikers. Jails and prisons have become the country&rsquo;s de facto mental institutions, thanks to decades of deinstitutionalization policies that have gutted federal funding for mental health facilities and moved thousands of people out of mental hospitals and into community treatment facilities, homeless shelters, jails, and prisons. As of 2010, there were <a href="http://www.tacreports.org/bedstudy">43,000 psychiatric beds in the US, or about 14 beds per 100,000 people</a>&mdash;the same ratio that existed in 1850, when the country first started to push for humane care for the mentally ill. Meanwhile, the US incarceration rate has jumped 350 percent since the 1970s, according to <a href="http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=nps">Department of Justice statistics</a>. Studies have found that the <a href="http://www.law.uchicago.edu/files/file/harcourt_institutionalization_final.pdf">increase in the prison population has actually been almost directly equal to the decrease in the number of people in mental institutions</a>&mdash;in other words, the percentage of the population that is institutionalized has stayed constant, but just moved from mental hospitals to prisons.</p>

<p>
	&ldquo;Jails, especially large urban jails, have become the default mental health hospitals for their cities,&rdquo; said Amy Fettig, the senior staff counsel for the ACLU&rsquo;s National Prison Project. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a job that they are in no way prepared for, trained for, or resourced to handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The situation has exacerbated what experts say is an epidemic of violence in big-city jails. Due to lack of state or federal oversight of local correctional facilities, there is little comprehensive data on what goes on inside jails. But in Los Angeles County, where the daily jail population averages 22,000&mdash;the largest in the country&mdash;<a href="http://www.aclusocal.org/issues/prisoners-rights/jails-project/jails-documents/">reports from the ACLU</a> have found a pervasive use of excessive force by deputies in the corrections system. <a href="http://www.aclusocal.org/issues/prisoners-rights/jails-project/sheriff-bacas-strike-force-deputy-violence-and-head-injuries-of-inmates-in-la-county-jails/">A 2012 study</a>, for example, reported that 64 people had witnessed incidents in which deputies struck an inmate in the head&mdash;in 14 cases, the inmates suffered broken facial bones, three inmates had to receive emergency operations, and one inmate was blinded in one eye. The ACLU reports have also found an alarming lack of adequate mental health treatment in the LA County jails, along with a jump in the number of suicides among inmates with diagnosed mental illnesses. This past fall, the Department of Justice announced it was <a href="http://zev.lacounty.gov/blog/the-next-front-in-jail-reform">opening an investigation into the jails&#39; treatment of mentally ill inmates</a>, citing the jump in suicides at LA jails in 2013 and the &quot;obsolete and dilapidated conditions&quot; for inmates diagnosed with serious mental illnesses. In New Orleans, a <a href="http://www.nola.com/crime/index.ssf/2014/03/mayhem_at_orleans_jail_persist.html">federal monitor said Thursday</a> that the high rates of violence, rape, and shoddy mental health care at the Orleans Parish Prison are &ldquo;the English definition of mayhem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;This is a very toxic mix,&rdquo; said Fettig. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a toxic mix for the prisoners, toxic mix for the staff, and unfortunately it&#39;s also a toxic mix for the public, because an institution that&#39;s designed to protect public safety can&#39;t do that when it&#39;s asked to be a mental health hospital.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has taken incremental steps to reform the treatment of mentally ill inmates at Rikers and other city jails. In January, the Department of Corrections announced that it would end the use of solitary confinement as punishment for mentally ill prisoners and instead house that population in special treatment units, according to the <em>New York Times</em>. But Murdough was housed in one of those special treatment facilities. His death last week prompted de Blasio to call for further improvements in mental health treatment and training for corrections officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	To spearhead those efforts, <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/082-14/mayor-de-blasio-appoints-heads-key-criminal-justice-positions#/0">de Blasio has tapped Joseph Ponte</a>, a veteran corrections official who is currently the head of Maine&#39;s prison system, as the city&#39;s new corrections commissioner. Ponte, who has a reputation for turning around violent jails and prisons, is known among prison-reform advocates for his <a href="http://www.thecrimereport.org/archive/2011-07-maines-dramatic-reduction-of-solitary-confinement">successful efforts to curb aggressive treatment of prisoners and decrease the use of solitary confinement</a>. So far, though, it is not clear how he plans to deal with the growing population of mentally ill people in the city&#39;s prisons. (Ponte&#39;s office in Maine did not respond to interview requests.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	But other attempts to reform large urban jail systems have been slow-going, and their success has been marginal, at best. In New Orleans, for example, the US Justice Department has ordered the prison to start implementing reforms that at the very least bring conditions up to minimum constitutional standards, &nbsp;but <a href="http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/paying-for-prison-reform-consent-decree-hearing-thursday/25068118">the city and the sheriff&#39;s office have been tied up in court battles over who will pay for the changes</a>. In Los Angeles, the&nbsp;Sheriff&#39;s Department has <a href="http://zev.lacounty.gov/blog/the-next-front-in-jail-reform">implemented only a handful of recommended changes</a><a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2013/10/08/39721/la-jails-get-29-million-to-implement-reforms/"> </a>to improve conditions and curb inmate abuse at county jails,&nbsp;after two years of stalling reforms.</p>

<title>Sothern Exposure: Boners and Vampires in the San Gabriel Mountains</title>

<p>
	<em>1985</em></p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;m somewhere on a mountain in the Angeles National Forest, and someone has opened the gates to the loony bin. A three-day shindig for alternate religions: witches, warlocks, Satanists, doomsday Christians, Unarians from outer space, ghosts and goblins, psychedelic druggies, wizards and elves, young kooks looking for something outside the boredom of the Holy Trinity. I&rsquo;m here with my friend Stephen, who is conducting interviews. I&rsquo;m taking pictures, and I just ingested a hit of mescaline I scored from a guy with finger cymbals and blond dreadlocks.</p>
<p>
	Drifting around the area taking pictures I come upon a naked guy who has no legs and walks with his hands. His long dusty dick and scrotum drag the ground like a sandbag leaving a trail in the dirt. I don&rsquo;t take his picture, and I regret it for the rest of my life. It&rsquo;s about 90 degrees, and people are running around naked. Down a wide path where merchants have set up to sell magic potions, lotions, scents, and handicrafts, I find a spooky pale-blue-eyed redhead hawking homemade jewelry. I don&rsquo;t feel a wind, yet her hair is kinetic like heat waves across her face. I&rsquo;m feeling the edge of the mescaline, and my digits are abuzz. She smiles and pulls back her lips like a growling tiger. Her canine teeth have been permanently capped with acrylic fangs. She&rsquo;s a practicing vampire. &ldquo;This is not a Halloween thing,&rdquo; she explains. &ldquo;We have numbers, and we&rsquo;re serious about what we believe. We drink real human blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I&rsquo;ve never had sex with a vampire, so I tell her I think she&rsquo;s hot, and she tells me she&#39;s never had sex with a guy who has a tan. She says she&#39;s from San Francisco and gives me her phone number, letting me know she may or may not respond to my calls.</p>
<p>
	I wander off to find Stephen, who needs me to photograph a ceremony that involves a topless girl with an ax and a faux human sacrifice.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144229/Boners-and-Vampires-in-the-San-Gabriel-Mountains-2resize.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 1074px;" /></p>
<p>
	When I tell Stephen about my vampire girlfriend he reminds me it&rsquo;s 1985 and she lives in San Francisco and drinks blood and maybe I should give it some thought. The mescaline is rushing into my system, and it feels like a toilet is flushing in my gut. I have an urge to go skipping and puking through the flowers while pushing aside anything associated with common sense. Everywhere I look people are naked.</p>
<p>
	After the ceremony I go to Stephen&rsquo;s car, which is where I&rsquo;ll sleep tonight, and take off my clothes, except for my watch, shoes, and camera. I like being naked and stoned in the woods. I&rsquo;ve been working out and look as good as I&rsquo;ll ever look, so I go swinging my dick down the trail.</p>
<p>
	At a clearing, at the hub of activity, a hot Amazonian Wiccan in a fringed rawhide G-string is at one with the cosmos, sitting cross-legged at the opening of an orange and white nylon tepee. I flex my muscles and butt cheeks and ask her, &quot;Hey, hey, how&rsquo;s it goin&rsquo;? Is it OK if I take your picture? I&rsquo;m supposed to get pictures of different people here, though I&rsquo;m mostly drawn to attractive women. What&rsquo;s your name? I&rsquo;m Scot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She has straight white teeth and caramel skin. She&rsquo;s in her mid 20s with a body like a surfer-girl goddess. &ldquo;My name is Sappho,&rdquo; she tells me. &ldquo;You can go ahead and take my picture. Should I look into the camera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;How about if we go into the tepee. The sun is all spotty out here, and the light inside should be really nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;I thought you just wanted to take a picture. We&rsquo;re not making a centerfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;We could, you know, make a centerfold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;No, we couldn&rsquo;t. Let&rsquo;s just go ahead and do this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	She goes into the tent and I follow, and she tells me nothing personal; she doesn&rsquo;t trust me and wants me to not come any closer than the door flap. I tell her that I understand and I&rsquo;ll stay where I am, across from her on my knees with my backside outside in the sun, catching some rays. She poses sideways like Cleopatra on a chaise longue. I&rsquo;m getting excited, and I&rsquo;m really loaded, and I start my automatic patter, saying, &quot;That&rsquo;s good&quot; and &quot;That&rsquo;s great,&quot; &quot;Just like that,&quot; &quot;Look at me,&quot; &quot;Lick your lips.&quot; She stops all motion and sits up covering her breasts with her arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pig,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;No more pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	I don&rsquo;t blame her. I&rsquo;ve got a bare-naked erection telescoped the same direction as the camera lens, and she&rsquo;s not a girlfriend, wife, model, or whore. I&rsquo;m trying to think myself flaccid, and I tell her, &quot;Uh, OK, sorry, I don&rsquo;t mean to be lewd. Thanks for the pictures, and if you give me your address I can send you a couple of prints.&quot;</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine, thank you. I don&rsquo;t want any prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
	The mescaline is now full-tilt, the tepee is breathing in great sighs, and I&rsquo;ve got purple ghost lights at the periphery of my vision. I crawl back into the open on all fours, and a few yards away is the guy with no legs, and he&rsquo;s not naked anymore&mdash;he&rsquo;s wearing a T-shirt and a duffel bag. He&rsquo;s just sitting there looking at me. I climb up to my feet, and I still have a boner. A ceremonial group has gathered close by, and they include an inordinate number of plus-size women. No one is naked, except for me. I&rsquo;m inside my own recurring nightmare of being naked and hard as a pinecone in a forest of women who are not here in praise of men. My stoned brain is telling me they were never naked and I just imagined it. Now I&rsquo;m in a hurry to get the fuck out of here. I start walking a busy trail back to the car.</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/144231/Boners-and-Vampires-in-the-San-Gabriel-Mountains-3resize.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 899px;" /></p>
<p>
	Around a curve I see a woman wrapped in black like she&rsquo;s a walking coffin. She kind of freaks me out, but I take her picture anyway and then jog the rest of the way to the car. When I get there I light up a Kool King and check my camera. I only have one exposure left, so I take a picture of my dick, then roll up the film and spool in another.</p>
