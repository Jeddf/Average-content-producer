<p>
  Last December, a woman from the Syrian community in Toronto reached out to me for help after a Syrian opposition Facebook page, for which she was an administrator, was expunged from the internet. She told me that Facebook had deleted the page, called Likes for Syria, in mid December, by which time it had garnered more than 80,000 &quot;likes.&quot; Several Syrian Canadians had organized the page shortly after the revolution in Syria began, back in 2011, and used it as a tool for posting news stories about the crisis, spreading messages of hope, and creating awareness in the Western world&mdash;something that many feel is desperately needed.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;We feel like our freedom of speech has been totally taken away,&rdquo; said Faris Alshawaf, another administrator for Likes for Syria. &ldquo;We have a right to talk about what is happening.&rdquo; Facebook had removed the page once before but quickly republished it after administrators made an appeal. Just days later, Facebook deleted the page a second time.   </p>
<p>
  Yet Likes for Syria is hardly alone. In the past six months, Facebook has deleted dozens of opposition pages&mdash;including one started by Syrian youth roughly a month before the revolution begun&mdash;because they allegedly violate the company&#39;s <a href="http://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">Community Standards</a> policy and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/terms.php">Terms of Use</a> agreement. Two weeks ago, the <a href="http://bit.ly/1aojZAO" target="_blank"><em>Atlantic</em></a> reported that Facebook opposition pages were disappearing. While I was doing more research about the issue, Facebook took down another page. This time, it erased the Syrian Coalition page, a move that shocked administrators and caused panic in the Syrian community, as it was seen as one of the most important and safe pages of the revolution. People from the Syrian community reached out to me again and sent me screenshot images of what had been reported to Facebook. It seemed clear that many of the images would have been very hard to take offense to and were not violent in nature.    </p>
<p>
  Now Facebook finds itself in an extraordinarily complicated situation. Its role as the world&rsquo;s biggest social platform has hit a serious stumbling block and put the company in a position where its actions are affecting a civil war. The <a href="http://aje.me/1cwjvUG" target="_blank">UN has reported</a> that the conflict has already taken more than 100,000 lives have already been lost. Facebook has become responsible for globally policing its users, many of whom are now part of increasingly violent revolutions whose messages are breaking company policies, but who have come to rely on Facebook to share information.  I can attest to interviewing people in hiding over Facebook chat for stories I&rsquo;ve worked on. Last spring, we interviewed a man named Louay Sakka, who, from his home in Ontario, has played a vital role in facilitating communications for the Free Syrian Army (FSA) using social media platforms, including Facebook.</p>
<p>
  All over the country, media centers have been established where displaced Syrians and rebels can hop onto a revolutionary Facebook page and communicate what is happening and where. To me, Sakka&rsquo;s role in helping rebels unite halfway across the world seemed pretty outrageous at the time, but this is partly how the revolution has worked.<br />
  <br />
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139647/SyrianCoaltion1.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 856px;" /></p>
<p>
  I reached out to the <a href="http://www.syriansupportgroup.org/" target="_blank">Syrian Support Group</a> (SSG)&mdash;one of the few North American groups able to provide help to Syria&mdash;to see if they had been affected. The SSG has also relied heavily on Facebook to communicate with the moderate members of the opposition. According to Dan Layman, who works very closely with the moderate members of the FSA and the US State Department to facilitate aid to moderate members of the opposition, they had. Layman says SSG was working on the English translation of the Supreme Military Council&rsquo;s (SMC) Facebook page, which was previously the moderate command structure for the majority of FSA groups, but it has been taken down, while the Arab page remains posted.   </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;This is really affecting us, because we have used these pages to help deliver the messages of what is happening in Syria to the Western world and to communicate with members of the moderate opposition in Syria,&rdquo; Layman told me.  He had reached out to the US State Department to try to determine what happened and was told that Facebook had its own group of employees scrolling through the pages looking for red flags that might promote violence or coarse language.   </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I think what is happening is that Facebook has determined that some of the things we were posting was promoting violence, when really we are just trying to explain what is happening. The opposition are not terrorists.&rdquo; Part of Layman&rsquo;s work is translating from Arabic to English messages such as &ldquo;In Damascus, there was four bombings and many martyrs.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s possible that someone at Facebook thought the language was offensive, but no one knows for sure. &ldquo;The revolutionary page was the easiest way to get the Supreme Military Council&rsquo;s position out directly to Western media,&quot; Layman said. </p>
<p>
  Many people in this community believe that the <a href="http://bit.ly/1bXaffr" target="_blank">Syrian Electronic Army (SEA)</a> has been behind a vast majority of the reporting and are in part to blame for the removal of these pages. The SEA is believed to work closely with the Assad regime, though they steadfastly deny it. Regardless, they have proven to be an intelligent electronic force that has claimed to hack systems such as Skype and Twitter.  </p>
<p>
  Last December, the SEA posted that they would be working toward having all opposition pages deleted, though it has since deleted that message. Whether they are behind it or not, these pages are coming down at a rapid rate. An internet-security expert&mdash;who requested anonymity&mdash;told me that if you were to draw a line from the Facebook pages being taken down and images being reported, it would likely lead to the SEA. Although the SEA clearly attempts to orchestrate mass report campaigns, which result in the review of flagged content, Facebook has improved its monitoring of mass reporting and clearly believes that the buck stops with the humans who review content for Terms of Service violations. The expert did not believe that mass reports alone could force page takedowns.   <br />
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139648/SyrianRevolutionPage3.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 323px;" /></p>
<p>
  Obviously, Facebook can&rsquo;t be blamed for what is happening in Syria, but there is now a need for them to respond to their role in the revolution and what might happen next. Could they try to shut down revolution talks completely? The social site is available to anyone over 13 years old, so there are obvious reasons why they would want to keep content clean. But many of the images that have been reported and deleted on the opposition&rsquo;s pages were warning people about the locations of reported bomb detonations. Other deleted messages included reports from the UN that notified the outside world about the state of the conflict. People like Alshawaf have family in Syria and no real way to connect with them, except through social media.   </p>
<p>
  I spoke to Linda Griffin, head of policy communications for Facebook in London, the same day the Syrian Coalition page was deleted. There&#39;s no doubt that Facebook is in a difficult position in this complicated situation, and she seemed aware that these pages played a significant role for communication and connection. Griffin denied that the SEA had hacked Facebook, stating they learned early on in the platform&rsquo;s history that people would try to abuse the system this way. She explained that if a page repeatedly breaches the rules, it would be shut and that it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it has been reported one time or 1,000. Shortly after our conversation, I sent the screenshot images that I received from the administrators of the Syrian Coalition page and asked her to explain how they broke the Terms of Use for Facebook. The following morning, I received an email letting me know Facebook had made a mistake with the Syrian Coalition page, and that they had put the page back up.   </p>
<p>
  This was considered a relief for many, but administrators for Likes for Syria and the English version of SMC want their pages reinstated, too. Combined, they had over 300,000 followers and experienced the same problems the Syrian Coalition page had. They have started an online petition asking Facebook to stop its censorship. All the administrators I spoke with are aware of what will break the Terms of Use agreement with Facebook and say they are trying to avoid this. One of the Terms of Use that is likely being broken is that nudity is not allowed on the site. Many of these pages will often post pictures of emaciated children and adults, and the images are taken down. Unfortunately, these are the images of war.  <br />
  <br />
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139649/SyrianCoaltion4.jpg" style="width: 642px; height: 856px;" /></p>
<p>
  There are very few journalists working in Syria because it is too dangerous (though you can watch our <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/ground-zero" target="_blank"><em>Ground Zero: Syria</em> series here</a>), and there are even fewer methods of translating to the Western world what is happening. In the absence of journalists, Facebook has become the primary tool of communication to the outside world. When Facebook decides to delete a page, it&rsquo;s deleting one of few tunnels the opposition has to access those outside of Syria. &ldquo;In doing that, and taking down the content, they are kind of doing the moderate forces a disservice. It&rsquo;s not terrorism at all they are taking down the pages of people who are directly fighting the al Qaeda&ndash;affiliated rebels. Someone at Facebook is missing the point,&rdquo; said Layman.   </p>
<p>
  At one time, Facebook saw its involvement in the Arab Spring as something to be proud of. Facebook founder and CEO<strong> </strong>Mark <a href="http://reut.rs/1j4dXVQ" target="_blank">Zuckerberg had discussed</a> his social media platform as being a useful tool. In 2012 Reuters reported that shortly after Zuckerberg filed papers to raise over $5 billion as Facebook went public, he sent an open letter to prospective investors. In it Zuckerberg wrote:  </p>
<p>
  &ldquo;We believe building tools to help people share can bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  It makes sense that Facebook shouldn&#39;t be a place to fearture organized worldwide violence, and they are very clear on that. Facebook also cannot be used as a place to support terrorism.  </p>
<p>
  This could no doubt become a PR nightmare for the billion-dollar company, but while Facebook figures out how to handle what&rsquo;s next, revolutionaries who have come to rely on the platform for connecting and communicating will need to tread very carefully and possibly start considering alternative options. But the question now is, where will the revolution go?  </p>
<p>
  Sami says that many feel the world has started to turn its back on them, despite the evidence of Assad&rsquo;s crimes, but that they will continue to get their messages out.  &ldquo;This will not end our journey to freedom and justice; we will still rebuild our destroyed country. We are made of will and determination.&rdquo;  </p>

<title>Paris Lees: I Love Wolf Whistles and Catcalls; Am I a Bad Feminist?</title>

<p>
  Last summer I went to Ibiza, Spain, where I was catcalled, sexually objectified, and treated like a piece of meat by men the entire week. And it was absolutely awesome. It got to the point where I couldn&#39;t even be bothered to follow any of it up. Every time some hot guy got fresh with me, I just thought, <em>OK, I could fuck you, but there might be some even hotter stud serving it up later</em>. I guess it&rsquo;s like when I used to live by the sea and never got around to going swimming. It was just always there, you know? You forget to get wet.</p>
<p>
  So as I look around the misery we call London, England, in March, forgive me for feeling a little sad that I&rsquo;m not in Ibiza, Land of Sexual Objectification. I love catcalls. I love car toots. I love random men shouting, &ldquo;Hello, beautiful!&rdquo; as if my mere presence just made their day. I like being called &quot;princess&quot; and ignoring them as I giggle inside. I like being eye-fucked on the escalator and wondering if I&rsquo;ve just made him spring a boner. That eye-fuck, by the way, is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199303/the-biology-attraction" target="_blank">an age-old mating signal</a>. I live for it.</p>
<p>
  So yeah, I&rsquo;m a bit of a slut. I also used to be a prostitute. And before that, well, a boy. Uh-huh. And I&rsquo;m a total attention junkie. So I may&nbsp;not represent all women. Who does, though? I&rsquo;m a feminist because I don&rsquo;t like men telling me how to think or behave or experience the world, and I don&rsquo;t like women doing it, either. Laura Bates recently wrote an article for&nbsp;the<em> Guardian</em>&nbsp;called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/feb/28/women-street-harassment-power-control-violence" target="_blank">&ldquo;Women Should Not Accept Street Harassment as &lsquo;Just a Compliment.&rsquo;&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;I truly admire the work Laura does with&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/EverydaySexism" target="_blank">Everyday Sexism</a>&nbsp;to highlight some horrendous abuse, and you should&nbsp;<a href="http://www.everydaysexism.com/" target="_blank">visit the site</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the shit people have had to deal with. It&rsquo;s awful. And she&rsquo;s not wrong. No one should accept harassment. Harassment, by its very nature, is unacceptable. But is catcalling always harassment?</p>
<p>
  The<em> Independent</em>&#39;s social-media editor,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/FelicityMorse" target="_blank">Felicity Morse</a>,&nbsp;loves catcalls, and I&rsquo;m guessing she gets loads because she&rsquo;s freaking hot. Even though I&rsquo;m probably not supposed to say that. She told me, &ldquo;If I&#39;m dressed up in a sexy little something, if I&rsquo;m sashaying down the street and tossing a head of freshly washed hair like I think I&#39;m Beyonc&eacute;, I find a catcall rather appreciative. But if I&#39;m out jogging or running to the bus stop, huddling past a building site in the rain, I find it intrusive.&rdquo; It also depends on the number of men and what they&rsquo;re doing: &ldquo;If they are working on a building site or something, where they can&#39;t really leave their work, it&rsquo;s almost traditional to wolf-whistle and pretty meaningless, so I don&#39;t feel threatened. But a big gang of young men in the dark? I wouldn&#39;t even acknowledge I&#39;d heard them.&rdquo; Would she give her number to a guy in the street? &ldquo;Probably, but I wouldn&#39;t have high hopes for a relationship! That&#39;s not harassment; it&#39;s flattering. If he doesn&#39;t go away?&nbsp;<em>That&#39;s</em>&nbsp;harassment.&rdquo; She&rsquo;d still ban catcalls on the basis that they upset many women, though.</p>
<p>
  This is kind of my problem with the debate around street attention. It&rsquo;s part of a culture that infantilizes women and teaches them to be constantly afraid. I wasn&rsquo;t brought up that way, and I don&rsquo;t feel frightened when some spunky dude comes and talks to me. I hate this idea that all men are rapists-in-waiting and that all women are victims-in-waiting. It&rsquo;s patronizing and doesn&rsquo;t help anyone. Many women are sexual and like to look and feel and be seen sexual. I&rsquo;m one of those women. But if I smile next time a man wolf-whistles at me, does that make me a bad person? What if the next person he wolf-whistles at is a woman who&rsquo;s been raped? What if he ruins her day?</p>
<p>
  Nichi Hodgson, author of&nbsp;<em>Bound to You,&nbsp;</em>sex columnist for&nbsp;<em>Men&#39;s Health</em>,&nbsp;and director of&nbsp;<a href="http://ethicalporn.org/" target="_blank">the Ethical Porn Partnership</a>, said there&rsquo;s a certain kind of middle-class woman that finds catcalls particularly galling: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sense of being sullied if an uncouth or lower-class kind of man&mdash;a white-van man, for example&mdash;heckles. But if it&#39;s a Roger Sterling type who can just about pull it off with a certain retro-sexist panache, the offense isn&#39;t experienced the same.&rdquo; Laura said that growing up in working-class West Yorkshire and learning to hit back with witty repartee was a kind of rite of passage. The same is true where I come from, although it&rsquo;s the blokes who need the comebacks. Let&rsquo;s just say Nottingham girls aren&rsquo;t shy.</p>
<p>
  Speaking of which, I wanted to hear from some regular women, not professional feminists, so I called my sister. She&rsquo;s super hot and cool and gets loads of attention from guys, but apart from that she&rsquo;s pretty &quot;normal,&quot; whatever that means. She&rsquo;s a property-services officer in Nottingham, 28, college-educated, of mixed race, and describes her sexuality as &ldquo;straight but open-minded.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s what she had to say.</p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE: Sista! I&rsquo;m doing an article on catcalling. What do you think about it?</strong><br />
  <strong>Natti:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t find it offensive; I find that it can be a compliment, and I also think that the guys are brave because they&rsquo;re just there in broad daylight, shouting down the street.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Me: Have you ever hooked up with a guy in the street?</strong><br />
  <strong>Natti:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, no, no, no! I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. If he&rsquo;s that sure of himself&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s arrogant, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>
  <strong>Me: Do you ever find it sexy?</strong><br />
  <strong>Natti:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, of course, sometimes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Me: Would you ever wear something sexy to catch men&rsquo;s attention in the street?</strong><br />
  <strong>Natti:&nbsp;</strong>Wouldn&rsquo;t every woman if she could?</p>
<p>
  I phoned my mom afterward, and she said catcalls are like periods&mdash;she hated them when she was younger but feels sad now they&rsquo;re about to dry up. Wow, mother.</p>
<p>
  One woman who emailed me in response to an enquiry I put out on Facebook&mdash;one of many who preferred to remain anonymous because they don&rsquo;t want you to, you know,<em>&nbsp;judge them&mdash;</em>takes catcalling as a compliment, too: &ldquo;I have friends who say they feel powerless and objectified when being catcalled. I think they made a choice about how it makes them feel, and I choose to feel empowered.&rdquo; She once hooked up with a guy from the street, but the sex was &ldquo;Ehhhh,&rdquo;&nbsp;so don&rsquo;t get too excited. Still, how many of you reading this wouldn&rsquo;t exist had one of your parents not made a pass at the other in the street?</p>
<p>
  The<em> Guardian</em>&rsquo;s Ellie Mae O&#39;Hagan said it doesn&rsquo;t surprise her that some women like catcalls: &ldquo;One of the ways patriarchy sustains itself is by convincing women that their worth is determined by the approval of men along a strict set of terms. Getting wolf-whistled at is a small confirmation that a woman is meeting the terms patriarchy demands of her.&rdquo; Couldn&rsquo;t you say that about pretty much anything, though? Like, if a woman tells another woman &ldquo;Great dress!&rdquo; is she letting her know that she&rsquo;s meeting the expectations of capitalism and the fashion industry and beauty culture? Or is she just telling her she likes her dress? Or is it a bit of both?</p>
<p>
  I&rsquo;ll be honest: Ideology bores the shit out of me, but Ellie does have a point about catcalls&#39; being an expression of power. There&rsquo;s a power imbalance, for example, between those who feel entitled to express their sexuality in public (straight men) versus those who don&rsquo;t (like gay men, older people, and lesbian women). Ellie goes further and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/global_campaign/en/chap6.pdf" target="_blank">cites studies</a>&nbsp;that suggest sexual violence is &quot;to an extent rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement,&rdquo; though I struggle to see any real connection between rape and the guy who wolf-whistled at me this morning. As Nichi puts it, &ldquo;I think it&#39;s a misnomer to draw a continuum between street heckling and the paltry rape-conviction rate. Street hecklers don&#39;t go on to become rapists any more than readers of lads&#39; mags do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  I don&rsquo;t want feminists to stop campaigning against the terrible abuse girls and women face every day in Britain, and I&rsquo;m grateful to anyone raising awareness about feminist issues. And men, for the record, I haven&rsquo;t spoken to any woman yet who likes being told, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to fuck you up the ass&rdquo; as you drive past her in the street. So stop it with that, you shitheads. I just wish we could make a distinction between harassment like this and harmless fun.</p>
<p>
  Because whether you like it or not, there&rsquo;s a big difference between &ldquo;Hello gorgeous&rdquo; and&mdash;as Laura Bates was, abhorrently, told&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hold a knife to that.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t want to make other women feel pathetic if they don&rsquo;t enjoy street attention, but I also don&rsquo;t want to feel pathetic for enjoying it. I don&rsquo;t speak for all women, and neither do you. I&rsquo;ll leave you with the words of 86-year-old Jinx Allen Craig, the woman in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.today.com/id/44182286/ns/today-today_news/t/subject-american-girl-italy-photo-speaks-out/#.Uxc4I-d_vuc" target="_blank">catcalling&rsquo;s greatest portrait</a>,&nbsp;<em>An American Girl in Italy</em>: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&nbsp;not&nbsp;a symbol of harassment. It&rsquo;s a symbol of a woman having an absolutely wonderful time!&rdquo; Jinx, call me. We need to book our flights to Ibiza.</p>

<title>Ultra-Orthodox Jews Are Refusing to Join the Israeli Army</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/orthodox-jews-dont-want-to-join-the-israeli-army</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 15:50:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140182/Daniel-Tepper---Heradim-Protest01.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  Hundreds of thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jews (Haredim) crowded into the center of Jerusalem on Sunday to protest against mandatory armed service. As things stand, they are exempt from being drafted into the military so that they can carry out their orthodox lifestyle, but a proposed bill could change that, and the Haredim are not happy.</p>
<p>
  They turned Jerusalem into a sea of black hats, white shirts, and long beards, but there were no fiery speeches and no chanting. Instead, the Haredim came in massive numbers to pray. The men carried out the Amidah, a standing prayer that&rsquo;s recited silently. They were observing Mincha, the afternoon prayer service. Bodies of all sizes swayed back and forth while their lips moved without noise. Haredi leaders had called on all males over nine to attend the protest. Even women were asked to join, though they stood apart from the men, in segregated groups along the periphery of the crowd. Around 500,000 were expected to show up. Local media later reported that the real number was between 250,000 and 400,000. Either way, it was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgiLVwZ1w9k" target="_blank">biggest crowd I&rsquo;ve ever stood in</a>, but it was eerily quiet.</p>
<p>
  Until last year, the ultra-Orthodox had been exempt from serving in the Israeli military since the creation of the state, in 1949. While the army has the authority to conscript any citizen or permanent resident once he or she hits 18, teenage Haredim are able to avoid conscription by studying religious texts in institutions called yeshivas. The Haredim feel that this study is a contribution to Judaism that is equal to&mdash;if not greater than&mdash;serving in the Israeli army. They see compulsory military service as a form of religious persecution, denying them the right to practice and pulling them toward a more secular lifestyle.</p>
<p>

<p>
  A lot of Israel&rsquo;s Jewish population pretty much resents the ultra-Orthodox community. In their eyes, the Haredim are unwilling to contribute to society, place a financial burden upon the country as a whole, and exert <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/circumcision-ruling-upsets-liberal-jews-201422314430727638.html" target="_blank">cultural control</a> over secular and liberal Jews through the <a href="http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Politics/courts.html" target="_blank">rabbinical courts</a>. Haredim make up ten percent of the eight million Jews living in Israel. They receive the most financial assistance from the state while being one of the lowest-employed demographic groups in the country. They are also a rapidly growing segment of the population&mdash;it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.hiddush.org/article-2308-0-In_2059_the_ultraOrthodox_will_make_up_between_23_and_40_of_Israel%E2%80%99s_population_says_Israel%E2%80%99s_Central_Bureau_of_Statistics.aspx" target="_blank">estimated</a> that, in 25 years, a quarter of all Israel&#39;s Jews will be ultra-Orthodox.</p>
<p>
  Haim, a teenage Haredi boy, came up to me at the protest and asked if I wanted to put on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKdr50iLqf8" target="_blank">tefillin</a>&mdash;two small black boxes worn on the arms that contain scrolls with verses from the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" target="_blank" title="Torah">Torah</a>. I politely declined and asked him how he felt about the protest today. Haim was born in Jerusalem and would be compelled to serve in the military if and when the law takes effect. He feels that the state is trying to lure religious youth away from their pious lifestyle, but today&rsquo;s rally had made him hopeful for the future. &ldquo;The whole community is putting their differences aside and coming together for the good of us all,&rdquo; he said. He thinks the law will pass but says, &ldquo;This protest is about showing the world that we oppose it. We oppose the state trying to get rid of prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  In <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19492627" target="_blank">2012</a>, the Israeli Supreme Court <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/23/world/middleeast/israeli-court-invalidates-a-military-exemption.html" target="_blank">declared</a> the exemption illegal on the grounds of inequality. The government proposed a bill last month that would call for strict numbers of yeshiva students to be drafted into the military while still allowing a certain amount of exemptions. Those who refused to serve in the military could face jail time. Even though the bill is expected to be passed into law later this month, it wouldn&rsquo;t take effect for three years, which is a long time in Israeli politics. The Haredi community plans to keep the pressure up, through <a href="http://www.timesofisrael.com/thirteen-haredi-protesters-to-be-indicted/">protests</a>&nbsp;and prayers, in an effort to stop the law.</p>
<p>

<p>
  The demonstration was an impressive display of the sheer numbers that the ultra-Orthodox can muster when they need to. The major roads leading into the city were blocked off. The main bus station and the light-rail system were shut down. Thousands of police were stationed in the area to prevent any of the violence that has recently&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn5mrHS08hw">erupted</a>&nbsp;at ultra-Orthodox protests. But on Sunday, the cops were conspicuously absent from the throng, choosing to hang back.</p>
<p>
  Flyers with protest slogans littered the streets, and young boys held up signs that declared in English and Hebrew, &ldquo;The Israeli Government harshly persecutes and tramples observant Jews!&rdquo; and &ldquo;You created the problem by establishing the State of Israel. Don&rsquo;t ask us to fix it by joining the IDF!&rdquo; This second statement is evidence of a strong anti-Zionist sentiment held by some sections of the Haredi population, most notably Hasidic Jews.</p>
<p>
  Hasidic Jews believe in a form of ultra-Orthodox Judaism that originated in 18th&nbsp;century Europe. They are easy to spot by their traditional dress and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payot" target="_blank">payot</a> (long, curly sidelocks). Early Zionism was actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredim_and_Zionism#Early_opposition_to_Zionism" target="_blank">opposed</a>&nbsp;by Hasidic Jews because of what they see as Zionism&#39;s tendency to champion secularism, and the belief that Jews made a promise with God not to establish a state in Israel using force. So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Israel" target="_blank">obviously</a> they&rsquo;re not all that happy with how things have gone since Israel&rsquo;s formation.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140185/Daniel-Tepper---Heradim-Protest03.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  One of the largest anti-Zionist sects, the Satmar, has large communities in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and Stamford Hill, London. The Satmar are so thoroughly opposed to the Israeli state that they accept no monetary aid from the government. One of their religious leaders recently declared a &ldquo;<a href="http://jpupdates.com/2014/02/23/audio-satmar-rebbe-kj-idf-draft-bill-survived-auschwitz-well-defeat-israeli-govt/">jihad against the Israeli government</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  I met Yakov, a 20-year-old Hasidic Satmar from the UK, before the protest began. He told me that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s better to convert to Islam than join the army.&rdquo; He explained, &ldquo;At least then you&rsquo;re still monotheistic. In the army, you&rsquo;re worshipping the state.&rdquo; Yakov is against any interference in what he calls a &quot;pure&quot; way of life. For him, being Hasidic means living a life full of prayer. He says that he has a closer connection to God by abiding to strict rules and daily rituals that fill his life with deep satisfaction and meaning.</p>
<p>
  He sees no hypocrisy in being anti-Zionist and living in Israel. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any other choice. I want to live in an environment where I can be immersed in a religious lifestyle. Living in Mea Shearim [a Hasidic enclave in Jerusalem] keeps me pure. I can go outside and not see anything secular.&rdquo; While being a relatively idyllic place for a Hasidic Jew to live, tensions against the state in Mea Shearim frequently <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjTLBTCNsII">boil over</a>&nbsp;into full-scale riots. This past July, a Haredi soldier who was visiting his family in the neighborhood had to be <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4402982,00.html">rescued</a>&nbsp;from an angry mob by police.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140186/Daniel-Tepper---Heradim-Protest02.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /><br />
  <br />
  Because Yakov is not an Israeli citizen, he wouldn&rsquo;t need to serve in the military. Yet he is a strong opponent to the idea and doesn&rsquo;t think the government can back up its threat to imprison those who choose not to serve. &ldquo;They can&#39;t arrest every yeshiva student,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to have to build detention camps for them and what&#39;s that going to look like? Putting Jews in camps?&quot;</p>
<p>
  He had a fair point.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Even if they started doing that, we&#39;d start yeshivas in the jails. Wherever they put us, we&#39;ll study; there&rsquo;s no difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  After the prayer service had concluded, religious music blared from towering racks of speakers that had been set up around the area. The mood was festive, and young Haredi men began to dance, arm-in-arm, in large circles. As the sun set, tens of thousands of Haredim crowded the streets. Encouraged by their sheer weight of number, they seemed confident that God would answer their prayers. Whether it&#39;s through political <span class="st">maneuvering</span> or divine intervention, Yakov told me, &ldquo;One thing is for sure: We won&#39;t be serving in the Israeli army.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Don’t Listen to the Republican Warmongers Shouting About Ukraine </title>

  <i>John McCain is one of the prominent Republicans using the crisis in Ukraine to call Barack Obama weak, again. Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/" target="_blank">Gage Skidmore</a></i></p>
<p>
  The millennial generation is often accused of being narcissistic, of inhabiting an imaginary world where events and actions are only real and important insofar as they touch on <em>us</em>, the super special ones who actually matter. There&rsquo;s probably a kernel of truth to that stereotype&mdash;hey, young people can be shitty and self-centered. But even the most hashtagging, selfie-taking, Thought Catalog&ndash;contributing 20-something can&rsquo;t match the sheer ego of Republican foreign-policy hawks, who think that there&#39;s no problem that American bombs can&#39;t solve.</p>
<p>
  In case you need some background: Late last week, Russia <a href="https://news.vice.com/video/russian-roulette-the-invasion-of-ukraine-dispatch-one?trk_source=homepage-lede" target="_blank">sent troops to Crimea</a>, which is a big deal because Crimea is in Ukraine, a country that has recently gone through the <a href="http://www.vice.com/vice-news/ukraine-burning" target="_blank">bloody process of overthrowing its government</a> and getting a new one. According to <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/hawks-ukraine-president-obamas-fault-104196.html" target="_blank">some prominent GOP politicians</a>, this is Barack Obama&rsquo;s fault.</p>
<p>
  Onetime presidential candidate John McCain said that the crisis in Ukraine is &ldquo;the ultimate result of a feckless foreign policy where no one believes in America&rsquo;s strength anymore.&rdquo; Senator Jim Inhofe got on his high horse to announce that the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;disarming of America over the past five years limits our options in Ukraine today.&rdquo; House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/02/mike-rogers-russia_n_4884922.html" target="_blank">went on Fox News</a> to say that Putin was playing chess while Obama was playing marbles. And Lindsey Graham, a sack of skin currently serving in the Senate, thinks that if we had killed more Libyans in response to the Benghazi embassy attack Vladimir Putin would have stayed away from Russia&rsquo;s weakened neighbor:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
  <p>
    It started with Benghazi. When you kill Americans and nobody pays a price, you invite this type of aggression. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Ukraine&amp;src=hash" target="_blank">#Ukraine</a></p>
  &mdash; Lindsey Graham (@GrahamBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/GrahamBlog/statuses/440920315292811264" target="_blank">March 4, 2014</a></blockquote>
<p>
  Obviously this is just a repetition of that old Republican narrative about Obama&#39;s being a weak president. Sure, he sent a lot of young soldiers to <a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/ali-meyer/74-us-afghan-casualties-came-after-obama-ordered-troops-increased" target="_blank">fight and die</a> in Afghanistan, he oversaw the expansion of using <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/10/obama-drone-counterterrorism-war-legacy" target="_blank">drone strikes</a> to kill people in Pakistan and Yemen, he bombed Libya <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/opinion/21Ackerman.html?_r=0" target="_blank">without Congressional approval</a>, he sent a SEAL team to assassinate Osama bin Laden in Pakistan <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/newsbook/2011/05/pakistan_and_osama_bin_laden" target="_blank">without the cooperation</a> of the Pakistani government (supposedly a US ally), and he&rsquo;s continued the long-standing American practice of spending a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/everything-chuck-hagel-needs-to-know-about-the-defense-budget-in-charts/" target="_blank">staggering amount</a> of money on the military (though he just proposed some <a href="http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/03/04/Obama-scales-back-military-spending-requests-defense-budget-cuts/9611393958680/"><span class="s1">cuts to defense spending</span></a>)&mdash;but he&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/2013/dgreenfield/obama-bows-shakes-hands-with-cuban-dictator-raul-castro/" target="_blank">bowed</a> to dictators and other foreign leaders when greeting them, so he must be a pussy! He won&rsquo;t even <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/the-hawks-hypocrisy-on-the-iran-sanctions-bill/283287/" target="_blank">go to war with Iran</a>!</p>
<p>
  Sometimes these hawkish critiques of Obama veer into territory that is legitimately terrifying, like when the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>editorial board <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026804579413900968932702" target="_blank">wrote that</a> the US Navy should deploy some ships near Russia. (As transparent, empty militaristic muscle flexing? As an actual precursor to maybe potentially getting into a war with Russia? Just because it&rsquo;s no fun to have these big ole battleships if you don&rsquo;t use them?)</p>
<p>
  More often, the Republican hawks are just kind of vague. Putin is clearly winning this game of chess/marbles&mdash;he&#39;s basically a genius, as far as Republicans are concerned&mdash;but it&#39;s not clear what moves Obama needs to make to decisively beat him at whichever board game is being played. &ldquo;Do something,&rdquo; Graham helpfully <a href="http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/02/sen-lindsey-graham-president-obama-needs-to-do-something/" target="_blank">suggested on CNN</a>, adding that maybe Russia&rsquo;s membership in the G8 should be suspended.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to exert energy,&rdquo; former NSA director Michael Hayden <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/ukraine-russia-conservatives-putin/2014/03/01/id/555507" target="_blank">told conservative media outlet Newsmax</a>. &ldquo;We just can&#39;t pontificate and condemn Russian activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Except the White House is already <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/03/obamas-response-russia-begins-unfold" target="_blank">doing a bunch of stuff</a>, including canceling a G8 meeting in Sochi and considering freezing the assets and banning the visas of some Russian officials, which is exactly what some Republicans have suggested. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g98fUr-sGcOPWuSGj6bWm55ny42w?docId=c6e3bd02-4165-43fb-b2f8-fbebc930def8&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">investors are panicking</a> about the invasion of Ukraine, damaging Russia&rsquo;s economy, and the US is coordinating with European countries to <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/02/inside-obama-s-plans-for-economic-war-on-russia.html" target="_blank">impose sanctions</a> on the country. It sure seems like Putin&rsquo;s aggression was a terrible idea. But don&rsquo;t take my word for it&mdash;here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/03/obama-ukraine-russia-critics-credibility" target="_blank">the <em>Guardian</em>&rsquo;s Michael Cohen</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Putin has initiated a conflict that will, quite obviously, result in greater diplomatic and political isolation as well as the potential for economic sanction. He&rsquo;s compounded his loss of a key ally in Kiev by further enflaming Ukrainian nationalism, and his provocations could have a cascading effect in Europe by pushing countries that rely on Russia&rsquo;s natural gas exports to look elsewhere for their energy needs. Putin is the leader of a country with a weak military, an under-performing economy and a host of social, environmental and health-related challenges. Seizing the Crimea will only make the problems facing Russia that much greater.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  If the GOP acknowledged that Russia&#39;s actions are more of a problem for Russia than the US, it would problematically leave the party with nothing to yell at Obama about. It would also fly in the face of the Republican tendency to see geopolitics as a high-stakes dick-measuring contest: If America isn&#39;t constantly threatening to go to war with multiple countries, it means Obama is telling everyone he&#39;s weak; if Obama had only <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/marc-thiessen-obamas-weakness-emboldens-putin/2014/03/03/28def926-a2e2-11e3-84d4-e59b1709222c_story.html" target="_blank">bombed the shit out of Syria</a>, Putin would have been too scared of America&#39;s big guns to threaten Crimea.</p>
<p>
  The last time a Republican was in charge of foreign policy was during the administration of George W. Bush, who disastrously invaded Iraq and Afghanistan (and who <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/2014/03/george-w-bush-putin-i-looked-his-eyes-and" target="_blank">was once buddies with Putin</a>). The politicians and talking heads telling Obama to &ldquo;do something&rdquo; are the same ones who have yet to meet a war they didn&rsquo;t like: Graham, for instance, has <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/international/Lindsey_Graham_War_+_Peace.htm" target="_blank">gone on the record</a> as wanting to intervene in Syria while keeping troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In their view of the world, whoever is doing the most posturing is winning. No wonder they seem to admire Putin&#39;s tactics so much.</p>

<title>VICE Loves Magnum: Humans Become More Honest When We&#039;re Pushed to Our Limits</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/michael-christopher-brown-vice-loves-magnum</link>

<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140206/Congo07-edit.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></p>

<p>
  Photographer Michael Christopher Brown documents places and people in transition&mdash;occasionally eschewing a camera for a camera phone. From Libya and Russia to Broadway and his current base in Goma, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Brown said he explores the &ldquo;relationship between distance and honesty.&rdquo; To paraphrase, Brown believes that as we are pushed to our limits, we become more honest.</p>
<p>
  His work in Libya in the aftermath of the fall of Qaddafi was the subject of the HBO documentary <em>Witness: Libya</em> and will appear in his forthcoming book,&nbsp;<em>Libyan Sugar</em>, to be published in 2014 by Twin Palms. With the phone lines failing us, I caught up with Michael over email.</p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE: What do you think of the work that you do? Do you see yourself more as an artist or a journalist?<br />
    Michael Christopher Brown:</strong> I always made a living from photojournalism, but ultimately it was too rigid in structure to allow for much growth. I never identified with photojournalism and was always more inspired by street or documentary photographers. Then, a few years ago, I found that I could express things better while writing than taking pictures, and through the writing realized the photography lacked definition. I entered a transition that continues to this day, aiming to use photography more as an individual, a citizen, than as just a photographer working to illustrate or report something. It was a big shift, from solely documenting the outward to documenting and analysing the outward and inward.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How did your career as a photographer begin?</strong><br />
  The photojournalism career really took off after I was given an internship at<em> National Geographic </em>magazine. Partially thanks to those jobs at <em>NG</em>, I was able to begin getting consistent work soon after moving to New York City in the winter of 2006.</p>
<p>
  <strong>When you are working in conflict zones, do you worry that your photography will end up being dominated by pictures of guns and injuries? How do you find art in conflict?</strong><br />
  Well, I live in east Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is an active conflict zone, but I&#39;m not covering the frontlines of armed conflict. I have the itch but avoid it because it is more related to addictions than beliefs. I need to identify with whatever is happening before planting myself on a frontline. I need to feel involved to a great extent&mdash;as if I were a participant. I felt this in Libya but not since then, except briefly at the beginning of the Syrian war. Not in Congo, however, because, although I am beginning to understand it, it is a conflict based on ethnicity and power and I cannot strongly identify with race or with the powerless or powerful. At the end of the day, I am just an average white boy from the Skagit Valley&mdash;an alien.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
  <em>Rwindi, Democratic Republic of the Congo. 2012</em></p>
<p>
  <strong>I see.</strong><br />
  Finding art in conflict, as you say, seems to be about finding a way to identify one&rsquo;s situation with the situation on the ground, and to do it in a personal way that others can identify with. That is what makes work inspiring, because it is about more than just great pictures. It is about having a vision, which seems to be, beyond adding to history, all we really have to share with the world. We can enable viewers to leave this type of work feeling inspired, not shitty, about what they have just seen, even if the work contains brutality. Maybe this is far-fetched, but I think that it&#39;s tough for say, the average American to look at pictures of foreign conflict and identify with them. But that&#39;s what we are hoping to do with the Libya project.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How did you hope to accomplish that? It&#39;s a tough ask.</strong><br />
  Libya was about having an experience and recording it using the same tool the Libyans used during their revolution&mdash;a mobile phone. But the complete work is more than that. There is a lot of writing and more than 400 pictures in the book, as well as a 20-minute installation of my videos from 2011, being put together by some friends at <a href="http://screenprojects.org" target="_blank">screenprojects.org</a>. I hope to exhibit those items, along with dozens of artefacts, in New York later this year.</p>

<p class="photo_caption">
  <em>Kashgar, China. 2009. </em></p>
<p>
  <strong>How do you feel about the Arab Spring now?</strong><br />
  After Libya, I was not interested in following the rest of the Arab Spring, though in early 2012, I did seriously plan a trip to Syria. I had just returned from Lebanon, was following the news every day and emailing folks to figure out a way in, until Remi Ochlik and others were killed. Then the questioning began again: Why am I doing this? I decided to wait and was glad I did. Though it appeared to be like Libya in the beginning, it quickly became nasty in all sorts of ways, turning into something that for me, as an outsider, is now unrecognizable.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Can you tell me about being kidnapped in Benghazi</strong>?<br />
  I was kidnapped briefly after the war was over. It was bizarre. We were filming drifters in Benghazi and then hopped in a pickup that drifted and flipped. A big crowd surrounded us as we crawled out, and the mood shifted when some militia saw the driver pull out his AK-47 and fake a shot into the air to scatter the crowd. He drove off without us but they thought we were his crew, or at least that was their excuse to take us at gunpoint. According to another driver who was with us, they had plans to drive us out of town to their base and steal our equipment, perhaps more. There was a gun to that driver&#39;s head, several militia vehicles involved, and they confiscated our phones.</p>
<p>
  It was months after the official end of the revolution, and the mood was sketchy and unpredictable, as the frontlines were not as clear any more. Eventually, as our vehicle moved through traffic, I was able to break out of the door at an intersection, walk through standing traffic, and yell for help until people got out of their vehicles and came to our aid. The militiamen sped off.</p>

  <strong>Jesus, that sounds stressful. In some of your series, particularly the one based on the old city of Kashgar in China, I&#39;ve been struck by recurring colors. With the Kashgar photos, it was blue and red. Is this something you are conscious of?</strong><br />
  Not really. Those were just the colors of the place, whether during the day or at night. With some of those images, the colors were tweaked by the camera, due to noise, because they were made in minimal light.</p>
<p>
  <strong>What brought you to the Democratic Republic of the Congo?</strong><br />
  I proposed a story on conflict minerals in DCR to <em>TIME </em>magazine in 2012, for their wireless technology issue. I stayed on after the story and have made several trips since then, up to now, where I have been living in Goma since November.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Your Olympics photos seemed to show a different side of your work. Did you approach sports photography differently?</strong><br />
  I went to Beijing for <em>ESPN </em>magazine, and I was their only photographer, so there was a big responsibility to try to capture everything, and often with longer lenses. I did not sleep or eat much and lugged around a big glass for the first week before the editor finally told me to just do what I wanted. Which was to wander and do what other photographers were not doing, though the access was tough. There is a reason why photographers from, say, Getty or<em> Sports Illustrated</em> or AP get all the best pictures: They have the best access, called pool access. If you don&rsquo;t have pool access you&rsquo;re stuck on the sidelines. So I walked around the crowd and tried to focus behind the scenes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Many of your series&mdash;particularly in Kashgar and Alaska&mdash;deal with remote places. Is there a particular attraction to these places?</strong><br />
  There is no longer an attraction, but at the time it was either just for assignments (Alaska for <em>National Geographic </em>magazine or Kashgar for <em>Smithsonian</em>), or because I was looking to photograph some aspect of people in transition. Sometimes they blended together, which was the case with both Alaska and Kashgar.</p>
<p>
  The Alaska piece was about a young adventurer, Andrew Skurka, and his solo trip through the wilderness. But it was really about a young man facing nature while totally exposed to the elements. Humans are so disconnected with the natural world; we don&rsquo;t live in nature any more. And nature becomes very scary when one realizes they are no longer in control. With Kashgar, it was about a city initially of Uighur people that was being dominated&mdash;or one could say &quot;occupied&quot;&mdash;by the Chinese. It was about the transition of the Uighur existence, which was vanishing in certain ways and being modernized in others.</p>

  <strong>Do you think the rise of citizen journalism is endangering your profession? Are you worried at all that people can just record what&#39;s happening on their phones?</strong><br />
  As Chuck Close said, &ldquo;Photography is the only art in which there are accidental masterpieces.&rdquo; Anybody, at the right place and time, is able to make a great picture, and even mechanized photography like Google Street View is able to capture great street scenes. But consistency is important if it is to be a profession, so the random great images Joe Public takes will never add up to the legacy of good pictures left by a professional.</p>
<p>
  What is endangering photojournalism is hardline photojournalist attitudes. But I think the more imagery, the better. Sure, more editors and curators are needed to comb through this vast trove of information (thank God for hashtags?), but really, perhaps we are entering the golden age of photography, because it is finally and instantly available to nearly everyone.</p>
<p>

<title>The VICE Report: Immigrants Are Walking Hundreds of Miles from Greece to Germany</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/the-vice-report/walking-into-europe</link>
<pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
As one of the gateways to mainland Europe, Greece is home to thousands of immigrants&mdash;but at the moment, it&#39;s not a particularly happy home. Many spend their days trying to escape the xenophobia and erratic immigration policies that characterize present-day Greece. More often than not, the immigrants look westward to countries like the UK or Germany, where, they feel, they will be able to lead richer, happier lives.</p>
<p>
  But even if certain sections of Greek society would welcome a mass exodus of foreigners, especially the ones who have entered the country illegally, the laws of the European Union mean that this would be easier said than done. What do you do when you&#39;re trapped in a country that doesn&#39;t want you? You can&#39;t just walk from one country into another that suits you better.</p>
<p>
  Actually, as we discovered, you <em>can</em>&nbsp;just walk from one country to another&mdash;VICE discovered that many immigrants who wanted to get out of Greece traveled on foot along an increasingly well-worn path from Greece into Macedonia, Serbia, and Hungary.</p>

<title>Sexual Abuse Has Become a Huge Problem for America&#039;s Bible Colleges</title>

<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  Samantha Field was a student at Pensacola Christian College in 2009, when she claims to have suffered repeated physical and sexual assaults&mdash;including two alleged rapes&mdash;by her ex-fianc&eacute;, a fellow student. Thanks to the school&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pcci.edu/pathway/PCCPathway.pdf">strict morality code</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t allow men and women to use the same elevators, much less be alone in the same room, Samantha was reluctant to report her story to the school for fear of inviting suspicion and scrutiny, if not expulsion. Eventually, other students and faculty members noticed something was wrong, and Field was called in to meet with college administrators, including the school&rsquo;s dean for women, who, Field says, told her that &ldquo;confession [is] good for the soul.&rdquo; When she remained silent, having nothing to confess, Field was sent to the school counselor.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I started to tell her that my boyfriend had made me do things that I didn&rsquo;t want to do, but she interrupted me and asked what I needed to repent of, and told me that I needed to forgive him, because otherwise I would have bitterness in my heart,&rdquo; said Field, now a writer who <a href="http://defeatingthedragons.wordpress.com/">blogs about her experience</a>&nbsp;leaving the Christian fundamentalist movement. &ldquo;I was trying to tell her that my boyfriend had raped me, and her reaction was to tell me that I needed to repent for my sins and not worry about my rapist&rsquo;s sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  A spokesperson for Pensacola Christian College, Amy Glenn, declined to comment on Field&rsquo;s claims, citing the school&rsquo;s policy of keeping student records confidential. She added that the college follows a &ldquo;well-developed set of procedures&rdquo; for students seeking counseling, but she could not offer specifics on PCC&rsquo;s policies regarding sexual abuse.</p>
<p>
  Sadly, Field&rsquo;s story is neither surprising nor uncommon in the world of Christian fundamentalism, where sexual contact is strictly forbidden outside of marriage and total submission to religious authority figures is required of all believers. Even though the Catholic Church has been home to the most high-profile pedophilia scandals, Evangelical churches, schools, and missionary groups have proven to be <a href="http://netgrace.org/wp-content/uploads/final_report_and_recommendations.pdf">similarly susceptible to sexual and physical abuse</a>, and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/05/27/pregnant-teen-victim-recalls-publicly-shamed-church-relocated-colorado/">equally adept at shielding perpetrators from punishment.</a></p>
<p>
  The issue of how Evangelical groups&mdash;and particularly fundamentalist Bible colleges&mdash;deal with allegations of abuse has come to the fore at Bob Jones University, where school officials recently fired, and then rehired, the outside Christian consulting firm Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment, or GRACE, to investigate the school&rsquo;s handling of sexual abuse. Led by Basyle Tchividjian, an associate law professor at Liberty University and the grandson of Reverend Billy Graham, GRACE has caused a stir among evangelicals for having the audacity <a href="http://boz.religionnews.com/2014/02/22/public-statement-concerning-sexual-abuse-church-jesus-christ/">to point out</a>&nbsp;the rampant rape and abuse among fundamentalist Christian groups. <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/09/26/billy-grahams-grandson-evangelicals-worse-catholic-church-sex-abuse/">In remarks to journalists last year</a>, Tchividjian said that the Christian mission field is a &ldquo;magnet for sexual abusers,&rdquo; and that he believes evangelicals are worse than the Catholic Church in the way that they deal with abuse in their congregations. (Tchividjian declined to speak with me until after GRACE issues its report on BJU.) At least <a>two other Christian groups have terminated</a>&nbsp;their relationships with GRACE, including the Association of Baptists for World Evangelism&mdash;<a href="http://netgrace.org/wp-content/uploads/GRACE-Response-February-10-2013.pdf">which fired GRACE just weeks before the group was scheduled to release its final report on a two-year inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse by a former missionary in Bangladesh.</a>&nbsp;New Tribes Mission, another Christian missionary group, ended its relationship with GRACE after the organization completed a <a href="http://usa.ntm.org/mission-news/2475/fanda-report-response-summary">2010 report on abuse at an NTM missionary school in Senegal during the 1980s</a>. (Although both NTM and GRACE say the parting was amicable,&nbsp;<a href="http://usa.ntm.org/mission-news/56891/ihart-update">subsequent NTM investigations</a> have been conducted by other outside consulting groups.)</p>
<p>
  The Bob Jones investigation, initially launched in late 2012, has been pretty earth-shattering for fundamentalist Christians. Although BJU <a href="http://www.bju.edu/about/answering-questions.php">publicly stated</a>&nbsp;that the GRACE inquiry was just to &ldquo;<a>make certain that BJU&rsquo;s policies and procedures for handling reports of sexual abuse both fully comply with every aspect of the law and ensure a loving, scripturally based response</a>,&rdquo; many saw the investigation as an implicit acknowledgement that sexual abuse is a reality, even among the godly students and faculty at Bob Jones.</p>

<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  BJU isn&rsquo;t your run-of-the-mill Bible college. Located in Greenville, South Carolina, Bob Jones University is the mother ship of American fundamentalism, with a network of alumni-founded congregations, seminaries, and Bible colleges that adhere to a brand of Christianity so strict it makes Jerry Falwell look like Dorothy Day. Students are banned from watching movies on campus, drinking alcohol, unmarried handholding, and socializing in parking garages, among other various forbidden pleasures <a href="http://www.bju.edu/life-faith/student-handbook.pdf?utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_content=%2Fstudent-life%2Fstudent-handbook.pdf&amp;utm_campaign=Redirect">outlined in the student handbook</a>.&nbsp;Any sexual contact before marriage is grounds for expulsion.</p>
<p>
  In a culture that fetishizes chastity to the point of <a href="http://generationsoflight.com/html/index.html">throwing father-daughter Purity Balls</a>&nbsp;celebrating virginity, women bear a disproportionate amount of responsibility for upholding these strict social mores and are often instructed not to tempt male &ldquo;urges&rdquo; with their low-cut shirts and tight clothes. It is a way of thinking that implies men only do bad things to bad women who tempt them.</p>
<p>
  Of course, all of this pious moralizing requires a heavy dose of denial. BJU administrators <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/08/us/bju-student-suspension-irpt/">have allegedly</a>&nbsp;ignored or punished students who bring up the issue of sexual assault. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/education/christian-school-faulted-for-halting-abuse-study.html?_r=1">Victims of abuse have claimed</a>&nbsp;that school administrators called them liars and sinners and told them not to report their attacks to the police because it would hurt Jesus. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;When I finally reported my assault to the school, the first questions they asked me were, &lsquo;What were you wearing?&rsquo; &lsquo;Was it tight?&rsquo; &lsquo;Was it low?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Erin Burchwell, a BJU alumna who claims that she was assaulted more than 40 times over the course of two years by a male graduate student while she was an undergraduate. &ldquo;The assumption was obviously that it was my fault, that I had done something wrong by putting myself in that situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Burchwell said that the investigation initially gave her hope that she could end 15 years of silence about her abuse. Then, abruptly and without explanation, BJU announced last month that the yearlong inquiry had been terminated, just weeks before GRACE was scheduled to release its final report. Officially, BJU&#39;s president, Stephen Jones, said that the school was concerned that GRACE had gone beyond the &ldquo;originally outlined intentions&rdquo; of the investigation. But the subtext was that GRACE had found something that the school didn&rsquo;t want people to see. Unsurprisingly, the backlash was immediate and intense. After two weeks of criticism from former students, and a scathing story in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/education/christian-school-faulted-for-halting-abuse-study.html?_r=0&amp;module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=Education&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article">the <em>New York Times</em></a>, BJU officials apparently realized they had made a big PR blunder. On Tuesday, the school said that it was resuming the GRACE investigation and would allow a report to be made public later this year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  If the goal was to contain the fallout, though, it looks like BJU may be too late. After the school ended the investigation, former alumni like Burchwell went public with their stories, many for the first time, sharing details about BJU&rsquo;s twisted approach to sexual-abuse counseling. And the reverberations haven&rsquo;t been limited to Bob Jones. A <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116623/sexual-assault-patrick-henry-college-gods-harvard">story published by the <em>New Republic</em></a>&nbsp;last week detailed allegations of mishandled sexual abuse cases at Patrick Henry College, a.k.a. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Harvard,&rdquo; including one instance in which a dean told a student who had been sexually assaulted in her sleep that if she were telling the truth, &ldquo;God would have kept her conscious to bear witness to the abuse.&rdquo; On <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TellTheTruthBJU">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.fromtracie.com/2014/02/growing-up-in-fundamentalism-bju-grace.html">Christian blogs</a>, people like Samantha Field have attested to getting similarly fucked-up abuse counseling at other fundamentalist churches and Christian colleges around the country.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been really surprised by how many people have come out with their stories&mdash;and I think the school is surprised by it too,&rdquo; Burchwell told me. &ldquo;But this would never have happened if they hadn&#39;t tried to end the report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  In response to Burchwell&rsquo;s claims, BJU spokesperson Randy Page said that, to his knowledge, &ldquo;no administrator would have told her not to report it to the police if she had wanted to go to the police.&rdquo; He added that BJU has decided not to comment on claims made during the course of the GRACE investigation until after the final report has been released. He also noted that, since 2011, the school has taken several steps to <a href="http://www.bju.edu/about/answering-questions.php">improve its response to students who report past abuses</a>, including implementing new awareness training and appointing a full-time abuse counselor.</p>
<p>
  For Samantha Field, however, the Bob Jones investigation offers little hope for breaking the cycle of abuse and victim-blaming that she argues has permeated the fundamentalist movement. &ldquo;Women in this culture don&#39;t realize that they have the right to have a say what happens to their bodies. They don&#39;t understand that it&rsquo;s not their fault, and they feel complicit in it,&rdquo; Field told me. &ldquo;They are taught [their] whole lives that women who do sexual things with their boyfriends are worthless, so they feel trapped in these abusive relationships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Field left fundamentalism after graduating from Pensacola Christian College in 2010. She said that she still has night terrors and panic attacks, which she attributes to not receiving proper counseling after her alleged rapes. Her former fianc&eacute; also graduated from PCC, she added. He is now a youth pastor.</p>

<title>Apparently, People Still Care About Cronuts</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/apparently-people-still-care-about-cronuts</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 18:21:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140238/IMG-0015.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  The Cronut was birthed into this cruel, vacuous existence on May 10, 2013, making it less than a year old. In meme years, however, it&rsquo;s ancient. The &ldquo;<a href="http://dominiqueansel.com/cronut-101/" target="_blank">most virally talked about dessert item in history</a>,&rdquo; chef Dominique Ansel&rsquo;s Cronut&reg; (emphasis on &reg;) caused one helluva fuss a few months ago, with lines of hungry trend hounds famously snaking around the block of Ansel&rsquo;s New York City bakery.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140226/IMG-0064.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  But that was then, and this is now. In a world in which the news cycle is such that we forget about shamed politicians, rape accusations, and the existence of Joseph Kony within days, any logical person would assume the shelf life of Cronuts as a five-hour-wait-worthy snack had surely expired. But the Grove, Los Angeles&rsquo; premier outdoor mall,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lamoth.org/" target="_blank">located across the street from a Holocaust museum</a>, apparently is a logic-free zone. I say that because hundreds of people recently lined up there, in the rain, for a chance to purchase the pass&eacute; pastry.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140231/IMG-0092.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  A promotional event for Barneys New York&rsquo;s &ldquo;newly converted&rdquo; boutique at the Grove, a gibberish-laden postcard told attendees that &ldquo;to celebrate this Fashion Mash-Up, [they would] have access for the first time in Los Angeles to the original hybrid dessert: the Cronut&reg;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140246/IMG-0024.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  I got to the Grove more than an hour before the boutique&rsquo;s doors were set to open; an enormous queue, snaking through the parking garage, was already at capacity. A standby line nearby held the stragglers who were unwilling to wake up before sunrise for the privilege of paying $5 for a mouthful of over-hyped sugar and flour.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140242/IMG-0080.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  The first person in line, a young, theoretically normal-looking woman sitting in a folding chair, noticed the gaze of my camera as I snapped her photo. In response, she contorted her face into a mixture of shame and displeasure. I, however, wasn&rsquo;t the one who put an icing gun to her head and made her sit in a wet, drafty parking garage for seven hours in exchange for the privilege of eating a deep-fried croissant. Every time I took her photo, which I did often because I knew it upset her, she gave me a surly look. If legend was to be believed, she had been there since 3 AM.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140233/IMG-0115.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  She wasn&rsquo;t the only person willing to abandon reason and personhood for a pastry. One dweeb allegedly drove up from San Diego (a two-hour drive under pleasant conditions, let alone in a goddamned rainstorm). Once allowed entry into Barneys, people wrote their own pathetic tales on whiteboards they held while posing for iPhone photos with a pained-looking Ansel, the deranged genius himself. One had to &ldquo;drive on the 101 in a downpour!&quot; Another &ldquo;woke up at 4:30 AM!&quot; My friend Rob, who witnessed the devastation alongside me, quipped that the whiteboard should have read, &ldquo;This is why the terrorists hate us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140240/IMG-0102.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  Thirty minutes to launch time, I set up shop outside the entrance and waited for the gates to open. An endless stream of people, all of whom looked upwardly mobile enough to afford trendy baked goods, approached and took countless iPhone photos of the (ample) signage. A woman in yoga pants (natch) was among them. After she took her shot, she clicked back to her phone&rsquo;s home screen. I immediately noticed she had the TMZ app installed. In that moment, nothing could have made more sense. A sharp-dressed man in his mid 20s approached and asked me to take an iPhone photo (<em>again</em>) of him and his equally sharp female friends, in front of the Cronuts sign. I did as asked. He immediately made me take it again because he &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t smiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140241/IMG-0117.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  A gabble (like a gaggle, but comprised of broads instead of geese) of fashion victims, the most excitable of whom carried a C&eacute;line handbag the internet informed me was worth more than my car, ran over to a similarly vacant, ostentatiously dressed woman. &ldquo;Brad said you can&rsquo;t eat a whole one,&rdquo; the excitable woman gushed, &ldquo;so we&rsquo;re gonna get three for the four of us.&rdquo; The next thing out of her mouth, devoid of any segue, was &ldquo;Oh. My. God. Rachel. You Look. So. Gooooood!!&rdquo; The gabble giggled and squealed and <em>OMG can you believe this line&ndash;</em>d for what seemed like an eternity. When the doors eventually opened, they abstained from getting in line. Hovering outside the entrance like vultures, they made small talk with the doorman, operating under the assumption that, at some point, their enthusiasm and entitlement would allow them entry over the plebes who had to wait. I kept them in my prayers.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140235/IMG-0045.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  The line itself was filled with a surprising amount of young people, squandering said youth, snapping selfies, and scrolling through Instagram. The typical cat mommies one would expect to be excited about new pastry technology were mixed with these young, &ldquo;adventurous&rdquo; types. When it rained, which it did on and off, both groups were sheltered from the storm, a fact I found unfortunate.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140236/IMG-0017.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  A sign, labeled &quot;Cronut&reg; 101,&quot; outlined the rules for consuming the pastries. &nbsp;They were to be eaten immediately (&ldquo;The Cronut&reg; has a shelf life of less than six hours!&rdquo;). They were not, under any circumstances, to be heated, cut with anything but a serrated knife, or refrigerated or frozen (&ldquo;The humidity from both will destroy the Cronut&reg; and make it soggy and stale. Keeping it in a cool dry room for a short time is okay.&rdquo;). For a baked good, these Cronut things seemed pretty uptight.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140237/IMG-0101.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  Despite the Cronut&rsquo;s limited shelf life, few folks ate theirs immediately after purchase. Most seemed content to merely wander around with their tastefully boxed treats, cradling them like C&eacute;line-quality status symbols. I watched a man take an iPhone photo of his while sitting outside the Grove&rsquo;s fountain. I wondered what the street value on a scalped Cronut would be. I wondered <a href="https://news.vice.com/video/russian-roulette-the-invasion-of-ukraine-dispatch-one?trk_source=homepage-lede" target="_blank">what was going on in Ukraine</a> right then.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140225/IMG-0098.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  I finally tracked down a young man who was eating, not photographing, the mythical pastry. He and his friends had waited in line for two hours. I asked if the wait was worth it; shrugging, he responded that the Cronut was &ldquo;merely OK.&rdquo; As the group joylessly chewed in silence, he continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not missing much, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re wondering.&rdquo; One of his female friends, vacantly staring into the middle distance, told me a bakery in town called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/frances-bakery-and-coffee-los-angeles" target="_blank">Frances</a> made their own &ldquo;pretty good&rdquo; version of them (which begged the question, why the fuck was she here?).</p>
<p>
  Indeed, despite Barneys&rsquo; claims that this was the &ldquo;first time&rdquo; the treat had been available in Los Angeles, multiple shops sell their (non-copyrighted) versions of them. One such shop, a place called <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sk-donuts-and-croissant-los-angeles" target="_blank">SK Donuts</a>, hawks an iteration called the SKronut. SK Donuts is less than a mile away from the Grove. As I drove by it on my way home, there was no line.</p>

VICE News continues its coverage of the rising tensions in Caracas, Venezuela, against President Nicolas Maduro&#39;s government. We visit a construction site near Altamura Square, where protesters are mining the left-over materials to use as barricades and weapons. As the crisis continues, the materials that protesters are using have evolved, and it seems they will stop at nothing until they see a change in their government.<br />

<title>Is Ketamine the New Miracle Drug?</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/ketamine-therapy</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 22:30:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140251/daniellecosgrove4.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  Danielle Cosgrove rested in a hospital bed with an IV slowly pumping the meds into her veins. She knew the drugs were working when the walls started to melt.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It was very, very scary,&rdquo; the petite 27-year-old said of her first experience with ketamine-infusion therapy, an increasingly popular but largely unregulated treatment for ailments ranging from intractable depression to untreatable pain, for which she is an outspoken advocate. &ldquo;I thought the walls were made of icing and they were melting down on top of me trying to suffocate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  For Danielle, the only thing worse than the hallucinations is her constant, excruciating pain, the hallmark of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder she developed after a devastating ATV accident in Qatar in 2010. She experimented with a series of invasive treatments and even strong opiates like Oxycontin, with no end to the pain. As a last resort, she turned to ketamine-infusion therapy in 2011.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Imagine it as having the volume of your pain system cranked up to a ten&mdash;everything that hurts after you develop the disease will hurt more, and everything that hurt beforehand will also hurt more,&rdquo; explained Dr. Enrique Aradillas Lopez, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of ketamine-infusion therapy&rsquo;s American godfather, Dr. Robert Schwartzman, and a high ranking physician in Drexel University&rsquo;s neurology department.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The neurons that have changed are disinhibited and in a constant state of excitation,&rdquo; like a club kid lost in a K-hole, Dr. Aradillas Lopez explained. &ldquo;Ketamine blocks the NMDA receptors and gives a chance for the neuron to go back to the way it was before. In a way, it&rsquo;s rebooting your pain system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  It was desperation that pushed Danielle to the street drug&mdash;Special K&mdash;she had avoided as a student in London. Since starting treatment, she&rsquo;s shuttled between her home in Texas and hospitals first in Chicago and then Philadelphia, subjecting herself to dozens of intravenous ketamine infusions and consecutive days of terrifying drug trips. She carries ketamine pills and a ketamine nasal spray in her purse. For her and untold others, the horse tranquilizer turned trippy club drug is the only medicine that works.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a profoundly valuable drug as [a painkiller],&rdquo; said Colonel Chester &#39;Trip&#39; Buckenmaier III, a military physician who championed ketamine as a frontline pain drug for American soldiers wounded in combat. &ldquo;Ketamine became something that we were falling back on when everything else was maxed-out and failing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Ketamine infusion therapy started in 1999, and the last decade has seen the rise of more and more unorthodox uses for the operating-room anesthetic, and in the past two years alone, the number of US clinics offering ketamine infusions to treat everything from fibromyalgia, a syndrome that causes long-term, body-wide pain, to eating disorders and OCD has ballooned.</p>
<p>
  Dr. Aradillas Lopez cited more than a dozen new clinics giving outpatient infusions. Colonel Buckenmaier wouldn&rsquo;t estimate how many military hospitals have adopted ketamine-infusion therapy, but said he&rsquo;s asked for his protocols roughly once a week. Dr. Philip Getson, another Drexel University&ndash;affiliated physician, who practices in New Jersey, put the number of clinics closer to 60.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably the antidepressant drug with the least significant side effects of any other antidepressant agent now in use,&rdquo; said Dr. Glen Brooks, an anesthesiologist who opened the New York Ketamine Infusions center in downtown Manhattan to treat patients with drug-resistant depression two years ago. &ldquo;Most of my patients are suicidal. Most have failed electroconvulsive therapy and transcranial magnetic stimulation, and in spite of that I&rsquo;ll still see a significant number of patients that have a dramatic response to ketamine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Researchers believe the drug works similarly to other antidepressants, by regulating the activity of specific electrochemicals in the brain. The difference, Dr. Brooks explained, is that while other antidepressants act on monoamines like serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, which together account for just 15 percent of the brain&rsquo;s neurotransmitters, ketamine targets glutamate, an amino acid that accounts for 50 percent of nervous tissue in the body. SSRIs must be taken every day, but a single shot of Special K can keep a patient smiling for months.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The only real side effect of ketamine is during the infusion itself: There is a sort of out-of-body experience,&rdquo; Brooks said. &ldquo;Most patients actually enjoy it. Young patients listening to their own music can really get into this out-of-body thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Some patients described feeling goofy and happy for about a day afterward, while Danielle described more of a drained and edgy feeling that made her antisocial for a few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Ketamine is FDA-approved strictly as an induction agent&mdash;or what knocks you out on the operating table. But off-label prescriptions are a common practice in the medical field, like the seizure medication Neurontin prescribed for anxiety or the narcolepsy drug Provigil given to patients with ADD.</p>
<p>
  Ketamine is different in part because it&rsquo;s most effective as an IV drug, one that must be administered in a hospital or clinic, often in combination with other strong drugs like Versed, to counteract its hallucinogenic effects. Infusions can last for hours and are sometimes spread over days. Experts have yet to agree on how much and how many doses of ketamine make a safe and therapeutic treatment.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;I do ketamine regularly: It can be up to every two weeks or every two months,&rdquo; Danielle said. &ldquo;It is a heavy drug to be putting into your body constantly<strong>. </strong>You want to be able to say, I&rsquo;m doing this until this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The lack of large-scale clinical trials and funding makes that point difficult to identify. Depending on the patient and the condition, Brooks administers the infusion in one- or two-hour doses while patients sit in a chair, similar to chemo or dialysis. Aradillas Lopez orders a ten-day stay with slow, continuous infusions at intensive care units.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;This drug will never be approved by the FDA [for therapy],&rdquo; Dr. Brooks said, noting that without the administration&rsquo;s bureaucratic gold star, most insurance companies won&rsquo;t foot the bill, either. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t that many of us out here doing this, so there&rsquo;s no standard of care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  According Buckenmaier, who&#39;s spent his career treating injuries that would have been universally fatal even a decade earlier, the medical establishment is losing out on one of the best pain drugs there is.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;In my 26-year career in the military, the deaths that I&rsquo;ve seen from pain management have been from opioids,&rdquo; the Colonel said. &ldquo;I often say, if only the drug in that machine had been ketamine, those people would be alive today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  But for now, ketamine-infusion therapy is likely to languish without set standards or FDA approval, confined to a handful of military hospitals and a smattering of research institutions, with offshoot clinics like Brooks&rsquo;s few and far between.</p>

<title>Undercover at One of the UK&#039;s Anti-Abortion Pregnancy Clinics</title>

&nbsp;<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/137139/001-CPC-Mystery-Shop-Copyright-Laura-Lewis1-2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 424px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
  <em>The author outside a Crisis Pregnancy Center (portrait by <a href="http://www.lauralewisphotography.co.uk/" target="_blank">Laura Lewis</a>)</em></p>
<p>
  If a British woman smashes &ldquo;HELP I&rsquo;M PREGNANT&rdquo; into her search engine in a panic, she&#39;s probably hoping to find a place where she can get impartial advice from a health professional who will take her through her options in a manner that is bullshit-free. For those who feel like they&#39;re not ready to be a parent in the UK, abortion clinics are a safe and legal option, monitored by the Care Quality Commission, which oversees them and makes sure they don&#39;t try to unduly&nbsp;sway that lady&#39;s decision.</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, her frenzied searching may lead her to something called a Crisis Pregnancy Center (or CPC), which is not quite the same thing. They call themselves &quot;counseling&quot; centers, and the National Health Services Choices website provides links to many of them, implying some kind of endorsement. Yet they are unregulated and run by Christian charities, and their advice has more to do with a moralistic view of the evils of abortion than with helping women make an informed decision. I decided to go undercover and pretend to be pregnant at some&nbsp;CPCs&nbsp;to help&nbsp;<a href="http://www.efc.org.uk/" target="_blank">Education for Choice</a>&nbsp;compile a report, which was released last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  As I walked up to a CPC in Chelmsford, I took a few deep breaths and remembered my cover&mdash;<em>My name is Jess, and I am pregnant</em>. I pretended to be a professional Essex&nbsp;woman in a nice relationship who had accidentally become pregnant. So I came to the CPC for advice and to discuss my options. I called and was put in contact with my &quot;counselor,&quot; Jean. We met at 2PM at Chelmsford&#39;s Lighthouse Center. A quick look at the center&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lighthouseft.org.uk/ index.php" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;told me that it offers &ldquo;one to one, confidential, non-directional, non-judgemental counseling&rdquo; surrounding &ldquo;pregnancy crisis.&rdquo; It claims that all of its counselors are &ldquo;trained.&rdquo; The website also states that the center is associated with the organization Care Confidential. Yet Care Confidential claims to have disaffiliated from all CPCs of this type.</p>
<p>
  Jean sat me down in a cozy room. She was middle-aged and motherly. We chatted about my situation. Because I was there to assess what &quot;advice&quot; is given at these centers, I tried my best to not ask any leading questions and to let the conversation flow naturally. It turned out that no leading questions were required for Jean to start pressuring me out of an abortion with a mixture of lies and heavy morality.</p>
<p>
  I was used to this. In 2011, while &quot;mystery-shopping&quot; a CPC, I was shown baby clothes and warned that having an abortion would cause my parents to lose a grandchild, make Christmas and family situations &ldquo;difficult,&quot;&nbsp;and give me shocking grief. &nbsp;I was shown fetus pictures and&nbsp;given literature detailing &ldquo;corpses&rdquo; being removed from women&#39;s bodies. A few months ago, at another center, I was told in no uncertain terms that adoption really was &ldquo;giving a gift&rdquo; by a counselor who very much wanted me to dismiss the idea of a termination and instead have my unborn baby adopted. The same counselor told me lots of women started drinking a lot more alcohol after having terminations. She claimed that some took on a &ldquo;personality change&rdquo; and began having panic attacks, which might not happen to me... but, well, it also just <em>might.</em></p>
<p>
  Jean told me from the outset I had three options: &quot;Keep the baby, and be a parent. You have a termination. Which obviously has consequences. Or you take the brave option... for adoption.&rdquo; Then Jean threw me a curveball. She told me that abortion had &quot;been linked to crime.&quot; Education for Choice has had reports of mystery shoppers being told they will contract breast cancer, but this was new territory. She waxed lyrical about how the grief, anger, and trauma of abortions have often led to women acting on those emotions and committing criminal acts. &ldquo;The anger, it gets so bad that it can lead to crime&hellip; It&#39;s definitely, definitely linked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  There was a lot of loaded language being thrown about&mdash;&ldquo;guilt&rdquo; and &ldquo;shame&rdquo; were two words that came up a lot. There were stories about post-abortion women who found out later that &ldquo;they can&#39;t become pregnant&rdquo; and saw this predicament as a &ldquo;punishment.&rdquo; &ldquo;They blame the termination... so it&#39;s something that always seems to be at the back of their mind,&rdquo; Jean said. At one point, she even recalled a bereavement in  her own family and likened the grief of abortion to the loss of her dead sister. &ldquo;A year back, my sister died. My only sister. She had been ill. I was fine at first. But about a year ago, I was looking at birthday cards and saw one that said &lsquo;to sister,&rsquo; and it suddenly kicked in that I don&#39;t have one any more. And this is the way the trigger hits.&rdquo; As sad as the anecdote is, the link to getting an abortion feels pretty tenuous.</p>
<p>
  She asked me about my family situation, and, predictably, the line I&#39;d heard previously about my parents and the &quot;loss&quot; of their grandchildren resurfaced. &quot;Because that&#39;s the other thing, you know... It&#39;s  your baby, but it&#39;s <em>their </em>grandchild.&quot; I noticed Jean had already started calling my pregnancy a &ldquo;baby.&rdquo; I was also shown a leaflet titled &ldquo;The Journey.&rdquo; It had a diagram representing a &ldquo;road to post-abortion recovery.&rdquo; The arrows on the diagram plunged down into a dark pit of &ldquo;Anger and Depression,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grief,&rdquo; &ldquo;Guilt and Shame.&rdquo; There was no subtlety. Abortion was really being earmarked as a last-resort option, with many dire consequences. I thanked Jean for the leaflet and folded it away into my bag.</p>
<p>
  As we came to the end of our session, Jean had some practical advice for me. She recommended a local doctor in Chelmsford whom I should consult as soon as possible. I took a quick look at the GP surgery&rsquo;s <a href="http:// http://www.beauchamphouse.co.uk/ " target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;and noticed that it had a&nbsp;line from Corinthians splashed across the opening page: &ldquo;For we are partners working together for God.&rdquo; I wonder what their view on abortion is. Upon a deeper dive into the Lighthouse Family Trust&#39;s website, I also unearthed another breast-cancer clanger under a description of abortion risks, stating that &ldquo;some studies show a higher susceptibility to breast cancer.&rdquo;&nbsp;CPCs just can&#39;t seem to get enough of the supposed link between breast cancer and abortion&mdash;even though the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (RCOG) has <a href="http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/NEBAbortionSummary.pdf" target="_blank">debunked</a> it.</p>
<p>
  The report from Education for Choice details more bullshit advice given at CPCs. At Reading Lifeline, a mystery shopper was told, &ldquo;I do believe that God gives the gift of a baby.&rdquo; At the Central London Women&rsquo;s Center, this pearl of wisdom was offered: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more risk of infertility from termination than there is from giving birth. Some reports will say there&#39;s as low as 1 percent chance of infertility from termination, and some will say as high as 25 percent.&rdquo; Again, RCOG <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/10622839/Abortion-scandal-abortions-increase-chance-of-infertility-claims-counsellor.html" target="_blank">says</a> that in fact the <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/1645.aspx?CategoryID=60" target="_blank">risk</a> is &ldquo;very, very low.&rdquo; And the Oxford Care Center peddled the breast cancer myth once more.</p>
<p>
  These centers are everywhere. Some of them are in hospitals and GP surgeries. The anti-abortion, pro-abstinence group called Life is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/24/abortion-sexual-health-coalition" target="_blank">on the government&rsquo;s</a> Advisory Group on Sexual Health and HIV, while Care Confidential, which until very recently ran the center I visited, has the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.careconfidential.com/InformationStandard.aspx" target="_blank">Information Standard</a> quality mark, a scheme commissioned by NHS England &ldquo;demonstrating their commitment to trustworthy health and care information as well as providing assurances of the quality of their internal processes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  I contacted the centers mentioned to see what they had to say about the Education for Choice report. Reading Lifeline said that the quote about a baby&#39;s being a gift is &quot;concerning and does show a disappointing absence of impartiality. Whatever the context, Reading Lifeline&rsquo;s intent is not to manipulate or enforce religious views on any service user...&nbsp;As such, the volunteer counselor responsible for this comment has been removed from all pregnancy crisis counseling.&quot; The Central London Women&#39;s Center was less apologetic. Its spokesperson pointed me in the direction of a study suggesting that having an abortion will make you 60 percent more likely to miscarry, even though the RCOG guidelines say that &quot;women should be informed that there are no proven associations between induced abortion and subsequent ectopic pregnancy, placenta praevia, or infertility.&quot; The spokesperson said, &quot;We continue to support hundreds of women who have chosen life for their children, as well as others who have had an abortion and who have suffered as a result of it.&quot; So not a whole lot of impartiality there. When I called the Oxford Care Center, they pointed me to their parent charity, Life. And then Life didn&#39;t get back to me with an answer for any of my questions.</p>
<p>
  The Chelmsford CPC&mdash;where I was told that there was a link between abortion and crime&mdash;didn&#39;t reply to my email asking for evidence of this, so I got in touch with Care Confidential, with which the CPC claims an affiliation on its website. Yet Care Confidential said that they had broken up with the center. &quot;The centers that are mentioned in the Brook report are independently run and are no longer affiliated to Care Confidential, following the recent disaffiliation of all centers,&quot; they said. &quot;The advice that was attributed to the centers mentioned is not endorsed by Care Confidential and is not supported by the BACP [British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy] ethical framework that we adhere to. Care Confidential have supported the centers with the provision of training, the website, and three Information Standard certified leaflets. Centers should not refer to themselves as Care Confidential Centers.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Personally, I&rsquo;m pro-choice. And by pro-choice<em>, </em>I mean exactly that. Women have choices<em>. </em>And all of them are fine by me. In 2007 I had an abortion. I was 25, unsure of myself, and in no way financially or emotionally stable enough to even consider having a baby. I decided, along with my partner, that the best option was to have a termination. I&#39;ve neither looked back nor regretted it since. Have I committed crimes as a result? Nope. Have I contracted breast cancer? Nuh-uh. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges <a href="http://However, the rates of mental health problems for women with an unwanted pregnancy are the same, whether they have an abortion or give birth." target="_blank">says</a> that &quot;the rates of mental health problems for women with an unwanted pregnancy are the same, whether they have an abortion or give birth.&quot; As far as my experience goes, have I found Christmas, being around children, birthdays, or anniversaries difficult? Not in the slightest.</p>
<p>
  I had a positive abortion experience, so I can see through the bogus advice I was given on my undercover mission. But what about everyone else? I&#39;ll gladly keep mystery shopping until I&#39;m too old to fake being pregnant any more, or until this kind of thing is stopped for good. It&#39;s sad to think it&#39;s probably going to be the former that happens first.</p>

<title>A New App Called Airpnp Can Help You Pee at Mardi Gras</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/a-new-app-called-airpnp-can-help-you-pee-at-mardi-gras</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 15:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140248/airpnp1.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 429px;" /></p>
<p>
  Today is Fat Tuesday, otherwise known as the culmination of Mardi Gras&mdash;an annual hedonistic ritual wherein thousands flock to an otherwise quaint and charming city, sucking the aforementioned quaint charm out of it for a couple of weeks and leaving nothing but their money, blood, cum, piss, and shit.&nbsp;During this time, New Orleans is a lawless place, turning a blind eye to socially unacceptable behaviors (like women flashing their tits for beaded necklaces) in exchange for tourism revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  One thing that is absolutely not tolerated is public urination. A simple piss break on the side of a house can and will land you a night in the can. I don&#39;t know about you, but rubbing shoulders with inebriated schleps in a drunk tank is probably the worst buzzkill ever. Luckily, a new start-up called <a href="https://airpnp.co/" target="_blank">Airpnp</a> has your back, bro. I shouldn&#39;t have to spell it out for you, but it&#39;s Airbnb for piss&mdash;instead of aggregating places to crash, it maps out readily available pay-to-pee toilets hosted by ambitious &quot;entrepeeneurs.&quot;</p>
<p>
  After going through the whole &quot;I-had-the-same-idea-years-ago&quot; bullshit with myself, I decided to call up Max Gaudin, the co-creator and self-dubbed &quot;PEO&quot; of Airpnp. We talked about pee and poop and what your options are when you&#39;re shitfaced in an unfamiliar place and nature calls.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140249/airpnp2.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE:&nbsp;Is public peeing enough of an issue to warrant something like this?&nbsp;<br />
    Max Gaudin: </strong>Yeah, definitely. There&#39;s just not enough bathrooms for the amount of people everywhere. It&#39;s the number-one thing people get arrested for during Mardi Gras. The police don&#39;t tolerate it&mdash;they&#39;ll arrest you on the spot.&nbsp;One of the phrases we use is &quot;If you use Airpnp, you won&#39;t spend the night in OPP.&quot; OPP stands for Orleans Parish Prison, which is the last place you&#39;d want to end up spending the night.</p>
<p>
  <strong>When and why did you decide to pursue something like this?</strong><br />
  The idea came to my partner&nbsp;Travis and I&nbsp;last year when we had to pee and couldn&#39;t find a place easily. We launched the site just in time for this year&#39;s Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How does it work exactly? Can people list any prospective urinal, regardless if they own it or not? I can imagine plenty of disgruntled exes getting revenge on their former SOs by listing their bathrooms on the site.</strong><br />
  In order to bypass this, you must have an active Facebook account in order to use Airpnp. That way you don&#39;t have just anybody off the street walking into your home. Also, people can rate their pee experience afterwards, which adds to the accountability factor.</p>
<p>
  <strong>What&#39;s the bare minimum requirement to have a bathroom listed?</strong><br />
  All you need is a toilet. We have everything from Port-a-Potties to high-end bathrooms listed. Also, there are some perks depending on what toilet you choose. Some hosts have even offered a free beer included with the price of their pee.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let&#39;s get down to brass tacks. How much is a pee-pee sesh going to run me?</strong><br />
  The service Airpnp provides is free, but different toilets vary in price. The entreepeenuers set their price, and usually, it&#39;s as much as someone&#39;s willing to pay&mdash;some people have paid up to $20. I guess it&#39;s worth it to some. All transactions are currently handled offline and face-to-face. We like it that way, since it kind of provides&nbsp;this unintentional social aspect to it as well. I&#39;ve heard stories about people becoming friends after using someone&#39;s bathroom.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Thanks.</strong></p>

<title>A Few Impressions: Revisiting &#039;Twin Peaks&#039;</title>

<p>
  Recently, I&rsquo;ve been hearing a whole lot about David Lynch, and not from the Lynch camp or concerning any new projects (what&rsquo;s it been, eight or so years since <em>Inland Empire</em>?). Rather, I&rsquo;ve been hearing about Lynch from people who have been re-watching Lynch&rsquo;s work, especially <em>Twin Peaks. </em>I was in junior high when the series came on, and I was more interested in watching <em>Beverly Hills, 90210 </em>(the first incarnation, with my man Luke Perry as D-McKay).</p>
<p>
  But even my young, culturally stilted self couldn&rsquo;t help being aware of the phenomenon that was <em>Twin Peaks </em>when it hit prime time. The first season was a juggernaut of creative innovation that television had been waiting for, as the response from critics and viewers clearly showed.</p>
<p>
  In interviews and in his book, <em>Catching the Big Fish</em>, Lynch says the development of the show was gradual: He and co-creator Mark Frost were approached to write a television show (they had been working on an ultimately unproduced Marilyn Monroe project), and they thought they would give it a shot. What started as a surreal mystery set in the Dakotas was shifted to the Pacific Northwest, its title referencing the layout of the fictional town, which is nestled between two peaks.</p>
<p>
  The pilot was shot with the caveat that they would film an encapsulated ending to the one-show mystery in case the show wasn&rsquo;t picked up&mdash;you can find this quick wrap-up, which has Killer BOB being shot by the one-armed man in the hospital basement, on the DVD box set. Lynch and Frost didn&rsquo;t think it would be picked up; the test with the network wasn&rsquo;t terrible, but it wasn&rsquo;t great. Then, seemingly against all (or at least most) odds, it was put on the air, and overnight it hit like a bomb. Everyone was asking: <em>Who killed Laura Palmer?</em></p>
<p>
  The better question, however, is, <em>Who killed </em>Twin Peaks<em>?&nbsp;</em>And the answer to this one is easy: the same person&mdash;we&rsquo;ll assume it was a network executive&mdash;who made Lynch provide a solution to the Laura Palmer murder. The key to any drama, if you want to keep it alive, is to keep the tension taught; and the key to keeping any mystery alive is to <em>not</em> solve the mystery. More than that, the allure of most crime mysteries, from Raymond Chandler to HBO&rsquo;s new series <em>True Detective</em>, is <em>not</em> dependent on finding out <em>whodunit</em>.<em>&nbsp;</em>More interestingly and realistically, it&rsquo;s about all the colorful characters we meet along the way, including their selective memories, the unreliable narrators, and the moral struggle inherent to all complex situations that blur the lines between right and wrong.</p>
<p>
  Another example of this sort of high-level storytelling with the crime as a backdrop is the film adaptation of Raymond Chandler&rsquo;s detective novel <em>The Big Sleep, </em>starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. The story is notoriously full of plot holes, but we love it for the characters, the atmosphere, the human (i.e., flawed) relationships&mdash;in the end, no one really gives a crap about the crime or who committed it.</p>
<p>
  The death of Laura Palmer&mdash;a small-town, high school girl whose mythos casts her as both a straight-A, community-service angel and, later, a coke-snorting, orgy-having devil&mdash;was the perfect inciting incident to explore all the submerged secret lives of what on the surface appears to be a quiet, white-bread community. When one bad thing bubbles to the surface, the small town&#39;s other secrets are dredged up in the process, in thrusts and starts.</p>
<p>
  When the killer isn&rsquo;t caught, everyone becomes a suspect, and thus any bit of otherwise normal business is suddenly interesting because it could be a clue. A truck driver dealing drugs to high school jocks, a man trying to get Norwegians to invest in his hotel, a logging mill burning down, a teenager having a crush on an FBI agent&mdash;all of these things become layered inside one another because of the unsolved death of Laura. But if you point to one person and say, <em>He did it</em>, the interest in all of those tangential strands is lost. It effectively props them all up.</p>
<p>
  Walter White&rsquo;s home life in <em>Breaking Bad, </em>a rather sad soap opera on its own, became infinitely more compelling the longer the show went on because it was the little bit of normalcy in his life that he was trying to maintain while building a drug empire, resulting in the show&#39;s gaining a wider viewership than it would have if it had just been about the indiscretions of a drug kingpin. Not so long ago, in the timeline of the show, Walter was just a humble chemistry teacher with a pedestrian home life, and this allowed&nbsp;<em>everyone </em>to get on board; he was one of <em>us</em>. And if Walter White had suddenly decided that he had enough money to leave to his family after he died and quit manufacturing meth&mdash;boom, no more show. If Tony Soprano had suddenly quit the mob&mdash;boom, no more show.</p>
<p>
  As soon as Woody and McConaughey figure out who the Yellow King is&mdash;combined with McConaughey&#39;s Oscar win for an awesome performance, albeit in a movie that discounts one of the defining efforts of the gay community, their unification to fight AIDS in the face of national disregard, making <em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> this year&rsquo;s <em>The Help</em>&mdash;then <em>True Detective </em>will be over, at least in this incarnation. But at least this show has sufficiently curbed expectations regarding the length and impact of its story line.</p>
<p>
  <em>Twin Peaks </em>paved the way for long-story shows; it broke the prime-time mold of episodic story telling by setting up a season-long mystery. This must be part of the reason for all the attention the show has been getting lately, at least in my circles. Lynch says he was pressured to reveal Laura&rsquo;s killer&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t even know who the killer was&mdash;and caving to the pressure has caused him a <em>deep </em>sadness.</p>
<p>
  The great David Foster Wallace wrote an essay about Lynch called &ldquo;David Lynch Keeps His Head,&rdquo; a smart analysis of the arc of Lynch&rsquo;s career at that point (1996). <em>Eraserhead </em>was the film-school baby of five year&rsquo;s incubation, a project that bears all the traces of a painter becoming a filmmaker in its emphasis of effect, symbol, and character over narrative clarity (Lynch claims that this was one of Kubrick&rsquo;s favorite films).</p>
<p>
  <em>The Elephant Man</em> was the young director playing with the <em>weird</em> as a subject, but dressing it in a relatively conventional structure. <em>Dune </em>was the project that showed Lynch that he couldn&rsquo;t fuck with big studios because his art depends on his full and complete control. Not because he&rsquo;s a control freak, as Wallace suggests in his essay, but because his process is one of constant evolution.</p>
<p>
  It&rsquo;s telling that Lynch followed <em>Dune </em>with <em>Blue Velvet,&nbsp;</em>because it shows him moving toward a low budget approach where he can have total control and bring the <em>weird</em> back into the <em>structure</em>. <em>Twin Peaks </em>is in many ways a sequel to <em>Blue Velvet</em>; it could easily have been called <em>Red Velvet</em> based on the red room of the characters&rsquo; dreams (and Lynch&rsquo;s dreams).</p>
<p>
  Lynch cites Transcendental Meditation as the source for his ideas, because it has opened him to inspiration from anywhere it might come. The character of BOB and the red room of <em>Twin Peaks </em>came at moments of sudden inspiration. It&rsquo;s hard to be in sync with such inspiration when a network is trying to make it conform to rating-friendly expectations, and in fact, treating such inspiration this way will kill ratings, as the second season of <em>Twin Peaks </em>clearly proved.</p>

<title>Kentucky Churches Are Tempting &#039;Unchurched&#039; Men with Free Guns</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/kentucky-churches-are-hosting-gun-giveaways-to-attract-men</link>

<p>
  If you&#39;re anywhere near&nbsp;Paducah, Kentucky, on March 6 and could use a free steak and gun, you really should make sure you&#39;re at <a href="http://www.loneoakfbc.org/2ndamendment.html">Lone Oak First Baptist</a>&nbsp;at 6 PM. A guy named Chuck McAlister is going to be putting on this whole time-share presentation thing about Jesus, but after that&#39;s over, there will be a raffle, and they&#39;ll give away 25 guns. It could be a long gun, a handgun, or a shotgun. They say they&#39;re expecting 1,000 people, so your odds are only about 2.5 percent, but you&#39;re guaranteed the steak at least.</p>
<p>
  Although women aren&#39;t specifically excluded from the event, the idea seems to be aimed at attracting men. It&#39;s part of a program the Kentucky Baptist Convention is calling&nbsp;&ldquo;outreach to rednecks.&rdquo; Roger Alford, a spokesman for the convention, told Louisville <em>Courier-Journal</em> reporter&nbsp;<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/article/20140228/FEATURES10/302280129?nclick_check=1" target="_blank">Andrew Wolfson</a>&nbsp;that the program emphasizes&nbsp;&ldquo;God, guns, and good ol&rsquo; boys.&rdquo; Also, don&#39;t worry: Raffles aren&#39;t gambling,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.probe.org/site/c.fdKEIMNsEoG/b.4223031/k.2F4A/Is_a_Raffle_the_Same_as_Gambling.htm" target="_blank">as long as they&#39;re at church</a>.</p>
<p>
  Paul Chitwood, the executive director of the Kentucky Southern Baptist Convention, loves the program, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think hunting is inconsistent with the Gospel in any way. A lot of guys in Kentucky hunt.&rdquo; He&#39;s probably right about the hunting part, but of course, bullets put holes in humans too, and when asked about that, Chitwood told the<em> Courier-Journal,&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;You could buy a car and run somebody over with it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140084/Screenshot-2014-03-03-14-05-15.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 368px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  Paducah, where the gun giveaway is happening, isn&#39;t famous for incidents of vehicular homicide, but it is known for gun violence, and I don&#39;t mean against white-tailed deer. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_High_School_shooting" target="_blank">Heath High School shooting</a>, in 1997, was a spree killing in neighboring West Paducah during which Nicole Hadley, 14, Jessica James, 17, and Kayce Steger, 15, were shot and killed and five others were wounded. The killer,&nbsp;Michael Carneal, used a&mdash;get this&mdash;long gun, a handgun, <em>and a shotgun</em>! But they weren&#39;t doing these church gun giveaways back then. It&#39;s just a horrifying coincidence.</p>
<p>
  In terms of knowing your audience and closing a deal, these giveaways seem to be working amazingly well. Chuck McAlister&nbsp;is a noted outdoorsman, host of Outdoor Channel&#39;s <em><a href="http://&quot;Adventure Bound Outdoors&quot;" target="_blank">Adventure Bound Outdoors</a>, </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em>owns more than 30 guns. He claims his brand of &quot;affinity evangelism&quot; has created a &ldquo;bridge to unchurched men so they will hear what we have to say,&rdquo; saying that he knows &quot;the hook that will attract people, and hunting is huge in Kentucky.&rdquo; He recalls that at an event in Michigan 13 months ago, a place where hunting is also &quot;huge,&quot; giving away 80 guns resulted in 282 conversions. That&#39;s a 3.5:1 ratio of souls to guns!</p>
<p>
  As an aside to the Kentucky Baptist Convention, I can&#39;t help wondering if this is really the best approach. I may be a liberal writer in a coastal city penning an article on converting Kentuckians to Christianity by giving them guns, but I know a thing or two about marketing, and this sounds a lot like a tactic the <em>New York Times </em>called &quot;desperation marketing,&quot; in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/03/business/media/03marketing.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">2009 column</a>. They were referring to the monetary desperation of businesses on their last legs during the recession. The journalist and pastor John A. Dickerson&#39;s book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Evangelical-Recession-The-American/dp/0801014832">The Great Evangelical Recession</a>&nbsp;</em>draws parallels between the state of Christianity and the state of the economy. Its inside flap reads:</p>
<blockquote>
  Our overall membership is shrinking. Young Christians are fleeing. Our donations are drying up. Political fervor is dividing us. Even as these crises eat at the church internally, the once friendly host culture of the United States is quickly turning hostile and antagonistic. How can we avoid a devastating collapse?</blockquote>
<p>
  I have a feeling &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJfJPxLntZU" target="_blank">Praise the Lord, and Pass the Ammunition</a>,&quot; isn&#39;t a long-term answer.</p>

<p>
  Expressing support for Israel is one of the least controversial things an American public figure can do. The majority of Americans are <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/161387/americans-sympathies-israel-match-time-high.aspx" target="_blank">sympathetic to Israel</a>, pro-Israel group AIPAC is perhaps the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mj-rosenberg/aipac-a-lobby-without-par_b_870943.html" target="_blank">most influential</a> lobbyist organization in DC, and criticizing the Jewish state has long been a <a href="http://www.veteranstoday.com/2011/06/13/why-criticizing-israel-is-a-%E2%80%9Cthird-rail%E2%80%9D-in-american-politics/" target="_blank">&ldquo;third rail&rdquo;</a> for both Democrats and Republicans&mdash;mention you think Israeli settlements in the West Bank are maybe not the best idea anyone has ever had, and you&rsquo;ll get zapped by 10,000 volts of strident criticism and accusations of being an anti-Semite.</p>
<p>
  In the past several months, however, the efforts of anti-Israel activists to portray the country as a pariah have broken through to the mainstream, making generic Zionism no longer the safe position it used to be and forcing Israel&rsquo;s supporters in the US and elsewhere to respond to the boycotts, divestments, and sanctions (BDS) movement.</p>
<p>
  Scarlett Johansson&rsquo;s endorsement of SodaStream, a company that has a factory in an illegal Israeli settlement in the West Bank, got a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/06/scarlett-johansson-israeli-settlement-boycott-activists" target="_blank">bunch of headlines</a> last month, but a more politically charged controversy kicked off in December, when the American Studies Association (ASA), an organization of academics who study US history and culture, voted to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/17/american-studies-association-backs-boycott-israeli-universities" target="_blank">boycott Israeli universities</a> for being &ldquo;a party to state policies that violate human rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Lawmakers in <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2014/02/targeting-academic-assembly.html" target="_blank">New York</a> and <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2014/02/targeting-boycotters-introduced.html" target="_blank">Maryland</a> responded in February by introducing legislation to prevent taxpayer money from going to academic groups that boycott Israel. (Neither bill has gotten close to becoming law.) At the same time, a <a href="http://freebeacon.com/house-bill-would-cut-funding-to-backers-of-israeli-boycotts/" target="_blank">similar measure</a>&mdash;called the &ldquo;Protect Academic Freedom Act&rdquo;&mdash;was introduced in the US House of Representatives after 134 Republican and Democratic congressmen <a href="http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/01/134-house-members-sign-letter-against-academic-boycott-of-israel/" target="_blank">signed a letter</a> condemning ASA&rsquo;s decision and accusing the organization of possessing &ldquo;thinly veiled bigotry and bias against the Jewish State.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The Protect Academic Freedom Act stalled, however, after a coalition of scholars, activists, and civil-rights organizations pushed back against it, arguing that the law would violate the First Amendment. The bill is so bad, a pro-Israel Democratic strategist <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/major-jewish-groups-wont-back-boycott-bill" target="_blank">told BuzzFeed</a>, that even Jewish groups like AIPAC won&rsquo;t support it.</p>
<p>
  Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian human-rights activist who is one of the cofounders of the BDS movement, finds it comforting that pro-Israel legislators are embracing such extreme methods.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Trying to pass laws through Congress that would delegitimize support for boycotting Israel is quite telling,&rdquo; Omar wrote to me in an email. &ldquo;It shows a heightened level of frustration, even despair, by Israel in its abortive attempts to rebrand itself and to win the battle for hearts and minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The BDS movement began in 2005, with the goal of isolating Israel economically and protesting its occupation of territory seized during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. The ultimate goal is to get Israel to change its policies, just as boycotts against South Africa in the 80s helped speed the end of Apartheid. The BDS argument that Israel is an oppressive colonial state has been strengthened in recent years as Israel&rsquo;s government has moved sharply <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/07/2012716133642958170.html" target="_blank">to the right</a> (an ideological transition <a href="http://mondoweiss.net/2014/03/influence-politics-government.html" target="_blank">mirrored by AIPAC</a>), and UN investigators have accused Israel of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/23/israel-committed-human-ri_n_178159.html" target="_blank">human-rights abuses</a> against Palestinians in Gaza.</p>
<p>
  In Europe&mdash;where negative attitudes toward Israel are <a href="http://www.richardsilverstein.com/2012/05/18/bbc-poll-international-attitudes-toward-israel-plummet/" target="_blank">much more common</a> than in the US&mdash;efforts by human-rights organizations and trade unions have persuaded some investors to cut ties with Israeli companies that profit from activities in occupied Palestine. In January, the Netherlands&rsquo; largest pension-fund management company <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.567548" target="_blank">severed relations</a> with five Israeli banks because of their investments in the illegal settlements; that was followed by the largest bank in Denmark&#39;s decision to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.571849" target="_blank">blacklist Bank Hapoalim</a>, Israel&rsquo;s biggest bank, over similar concerns, as well as Luxembourg&rsquo;s government pension fund&#39;s <a href="http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/02/26/352306/luxembourg-pension-fund-boycotts-israel/" target="_blank">motion to boycott</a> several Israeli companies. Around the same time, Norway announced that its state-owned investment fund <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4483124,00.html" target="_blank">wouldn&rsquo;t be investing</a> in two Israeli construction companies, because of their involvement in building illegal settlements in East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The biggest hindrance for peace talks and for a political solution is the spreading of the illegal settlements,&rdquo; Liv T&oslash;rres, the general secretary for Norwegian People&rsquo;s Aid, a humanitarian organization that lobbied for the Norwegian boycott, told me. &ldquo;This is an issue of respecting international law and finding a political solution to the one conflict that has been unsolved and is lying there like a sore aching point for the rest of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Shahar Azani, the Israeli consul for media affairs in New York, told me the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem &ldquo;needs to be decided,&rdquo; but he emphasized that the settlements are often used to obscure the real issues, like Palestinian hostility toward Israel.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Unfortunately, there have been numerous attacks from the Palestinian and the Arab side against Israel,&rdquo; he said, noting that Hamas&mdash;a group that has said it wants to destroy Israel&mdash;took over the Gaza Strip after Israel withdrew its settlers in 2005. &ldquo;So the ordinary Israeli tells himself, when we take our people out without a final agreement, we allow ourselves to be exposed to tremendous risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Far from taking anyone out, the Israeli government recently announced plans to build 1,400 new homes for settlers in Palestinian territory, despite <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=1%2C400+new+settler+homes&amp;oq=1%2C400+new+settler+homes&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.10151j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=91&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">protests</a> from many world leaders that new settlements would endanger ongoing peace talks between Israel and Palestine. It&#39;s still not safe for US officials to speak out against the Jewish state, however. In early February, Secretary of State John Kerry said that Israel could face further boycotts if the two countries fail to reach an agreement, prompting immediate <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/02/05/major-jewish-organization-slams-john-kerry-over-israel-boycott-comments/" target="_blank">criticism</a> from Israeli officials and American Jewish organizations, which suggested that Kerry was encouraging Palestinians to favor boycotts over negotiations. Yesterday, Kerry <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/164883/john-kerry-makes-no-apologies" target="_blank">spoke at an AIPAC policy conference</a> and emphasized that he didn&rsquo;t support the BDS movement, saying, &ldquo; For more than 30 years, I have staunchly, loudly, and unapologetically opposed boycotts of Israel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, Israel&#39;s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/9666-israeli-ministers-discuss-using-lawyers-and-mossad-to-fight-bds" target="_blank">convened a meeting</a> with senior ministers several days after Kerry&rsquo;s remarks to discuss ways to combat the growing threat of boycotts, including suing companies that boycott those who do business in the settlements and encouraging anti-boycott legislation in &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; countries. (Calling for boycotts against Israel is already illegal within Israel thanks to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_for_Prevention_of_Damage_to_State_of_Israel_through_Boycott" target="_blank">law</a> passed in 2011.)</p>
<p>
  Though legislation targeted at academic boycotts smells too much like a violation of free speech to become law, famed trial lawyer and Israel booster Alan Dershowitz argues that the Constitution does not protect economic boycotts. He told me that Congress could theoretically pass a law to prevent companies that participate in a boycott of Israel from doing business in the United States.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;You can make boycotts illegal, actually criminal, for American companies: Let&rsquo;s assume that Arizona has a law passed in which businesses can boycott gays. The federal government could make that illegal,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To me, this is analogous to the legislation boycotting gays or boycotting blacks or boycotting any other protected group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  The United States already has anti-boycott laws in place. In 1977, Jimmy Carter made it illegal for American companies to participate in the Arab League boycott against Israel (some companies did business in the Arab world anyway and just paid a fine). Although that boycott has almost disappeared&mdash;Syria and Lebanon are the only countries that still enforce it&mdash;it does set a precedent for outlawing boycott efforts that are not sanctioned by the government.</p>
<p>
  Dima Khalidi, the director of Palestinian Solidarity Legal Support, an activist group, disagreed, telling me that boycotts that are enacted to bring about political change are unquestionably protected by the First Amendment.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Like the boycott campaigns against Jim Crow in the southern US, or against the South African apartheid regime, the BDS movement involves nonviolent campaigns by ordinary people to pressure governments to redress a grave injustice,&rdquo; she wrote in an email.</p>
<p>
  The BDS movement is clearly making waves, as demonstrated by the impact it had on SodaStream. The Israeli maker of carbonation machines got a lot of bad press after Scarlett Johansson had a public falling-out with the UK-based charity Oxfam over her endorsement of their product, and SodaStream&rsquo;s stock dropped last month to its lowest point in years, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-03/sodastream-slumps-on-sanction-campaign-over-jewish-settlements.html" target="_blank">possibly as a result</a> of that controversy and the threat of continued boycotts against the company.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;The mainstream messaging of that story, at least in the UK, was that here is a celebrity forced to pick between a respected development NGO and an Israeli company. And the idea that those two are incompatible,&rdquo; said British author and pro-Palestinian activist Ben White. &ldquo;And it means that people will think twice about opening one&rsquo;s own business or entity to that kind of reputational risk.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Texas Cops Are Having a Great Time Stealing Cardboard Signs from the Homeless</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/texas-cops-are-having-a-great-time-stealing-cardboard-signs-from-the-homeless</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 15:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140067/4374410040-359892b049-b.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 512px;" /><br />
<span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 16px;"><i>We dare you to steal this guy&#39;s sign. Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meddygarnet/">Morgan Garnett</a></i></span></p>
<p>
  When you walk by a homeless person begging for change, you&rsquo;ve got a few options. You can (A) toss him a quarter, (B) pretend you don&rsquo;t see him and feel either crushing guilt or burning self-righteousness, depending on your disposition, or (C) stop and have a conversation, because guess what&mdash;<em>homeless people</em> <em>are actual humans that you can talk to without their hobo germs violating your yuppie bubble.</em></p>
<p>
  There&rsquo;s one thing you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> do, though, and that&rsquo;s stage a contest with your friends to see who can steal the most cardboard hobo signs. That&#39;s what officers Derek Hester and Daniel Zoelzer were caught doing this past November in Midland, Texas, according to <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/news/state/headlines/20140227-midland-officers-suspended-for-competing-to-grab-signs-from-homeless.ece">an internal affairs investigation dug up last week</a>.</p>
<p>
  Panhandling doesn&#39;t violate any city law in Midland, but on&nbsp;November 20, eight cardboard signs were found in the trunk of Hester&rsquo;s patrol car. After he was reprimanded, he texted a warning to Zoelzer, who allegedly threw away 10 signs. The officers claimed they snagged the signs while issuing criminal trespass warnings, but the investigation found no trespass warnings issued to homeless people attributed to either of them in the past year. Among the signs was one that read &quot;Anything helps, God Bless.&quot; Later, when the officers&#39; text messages were retrieved, a different picture emerged. On November 21, a day after he was caught, Hester sent Zoelzer the following (very <em>sic</em>) text message: &quot;My bad man when he first ask me about it he didn&#39;t seem mad or anything so I just told him me and u wereaking a game outta it when we&#39;d traspass them and stuff.&quot; Hester and Zoelzer only ended up with a three-day suspension after weeks of their &quot;game.&quot;</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Besides being against Midland Police policy, it&rsquo;s also a First Amendment violation,&rdquo; Cassandra Champion told me. Cassandra is an attorney at <a href="http://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/">Texas Civil Rights Project</a>. She noted that there have been 109 instances in the past two years where officers were investigated by internal affairs, but only half of the cases were considered legitimate. Speaking about the Midlands cardboard scavenger hunt, she noted, &ldquo;individuals have the right to free speech, whether that comes as speaking in a public forum or carrying a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  She told me that the Midland area is staunchly conservative, but that there are no laws against begging. The police department didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to my request for more information, but it&rsquo;s clear they aren&rsquo;t exactly proud of their boys in blue&mdash;the same officers were reported to have collected booty like brass knuckles, scales, and knives during patrol, and never logging them as evidence.</p>
<p>
  What galls Midland residents most is the three-day suspension, which appears to be a largely perfunctory punishment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s enough,&rdquo; Cassandra told me. &ldquo;Three days off for officers making a game of people&rsquo;s lives is a terrible injustice for those who are supposed to hold these officers to the highest level of accountability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140068/dustinground-homelessinaustin.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 417px;" /><br />
  <span style="font-size: 11px; font-family: Arial; line-height: 16px;"><i>Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meddygarnet/">Dustin Ground</a></i></span></p>
<p>
  Cassandra didn&rsquo;t speculate on what the proper sentence would be for a case like this, but there are reasons to think it could have been much more harsh. According to <em>Addressing Police Misconduct</em>, a pamphlet from the Department of Justice, there is a police misconduct provision that &ldquo;makes it unlawful for State or local law enforcement officers to engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that deprives persons of rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. (42 U.S.C. 5 14141). The types of conduct covered by this law include, among other things, excessive force, discriminatory harassment, false arrests, coercive sexual conduct, and unlawful stops, searches or arrests. In order to be covered by this law, the misconduct must constitute a &lsquo;pattern or practice&rsquo;&mdash;it may not simply be an isolated incident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  It would seem that a two-week long game of hobo treasure hunt would be considered a &ldquo;pattern or practice,&rdquo; but police discipline is often self-regulated, especially in lower-level cases.</p>
<p>
  After investigating cases of police harassment of innocent civilians, the <a href="http://www.texascivilrightsproject.org/docs/sapd/Police_Misconduct_in_San_Antonio-TCRP_Human_Rights_Report.pdf">Texas Civil Rights Project recommended</a> that the San Antonio Police Department create a &ldquo;disciplinary matrix,&rdquo; to establish how to respond to such violations. For example, under current law, a recent case of the San Antonio Police <a href="http://www.qsanantonio.com/lesbian-home-raided2.html">harassing a lesbian couple</a> in their home after they raided the wrong house during a drug bust wasn&rsquo;t originally considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Yet a court of appeals in New Orleans eventually ruled that it <em>was</em> a violation and granted the couple a settlement of $145,000, thanks to efforts of the Texas Civil Rights Project. It&rsquo;s fair to say that the homeless people of Midland who had their First Amendment rights violated could benefit from that kind of justice.</p>
<p>
  The cops in Texas may think making a game out of the way people collect money to survive is entertaining. The next probelm is that those trying to help are being ignored. Cassandra believes that the justice system is happy to punish the public, but they change their tone when they find themselves as the defendant: &ldquo;I just hope they do everything they can to enforce the most correct and just policies.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Corey Olsen Photographs the Blandness All Around Us</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/corey-olsen-photographs-the-blandness-all-around-us</link>
<pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<div>
On the surface, Corey Olsen depicts a wholesome sort of American everyplace. Some of his portraits even look like the excessively bland pictures that might come in a store-bought picture frame. When I said this to photographer Bruce Gilden, he told me, &quot;Yeah, but you throw those pictures away.&quot; I think that actually sums it up pretty well&mdash; these pictures play with the kinds of disposable imagery that surrounds us.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  Having grown up in Maine, Corey is now a senior in photography at School of Visual Arts, in New York. It was there he first heard about City Island, a 1.5-mile-long spit of land off the Bronx that looks a little like a New England fishing town. Corey is interested in the interchangeability of images, the transportation of place, and the strangeness of constructing the aesthetic of a WASP-y New England town in the NYC borough that is home to the poorest congressional district in the US. Corey recently stopped by the VICE offices to tell me more.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>VICE: So, City Island is in the Bronx.</strong></div>
<div>
  <strong>Corey Olsen: </strong>You take the 6 train all the way up to Pelham Bay Park. When you get off the train, you feel like you&rsquo;re in The Bronx, but then you take an MTA bus over a bridge, and you&rsquo;re on this quaint little island. It&rsquo;s a strange mix between the Bronx, Long Island, and a New England fishing town. It&rsquo;s bizarre and beautiful at the same time.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Some of these look like photos that would come in picture frames.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
  Yeah, I bought a frame recently at a church thrift store on City Island. It came with a picture of a man and a woman on a sailboat in it, and I was thinking about including that in the series. I just like it.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  One of my teachers asked me if I was making fun of photography with the portraits. I am poking fun a little, but in the way you poke fun at a friend, because you like the off things about them.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Have you talked to people who actually live there?</strong></div>
<div>
  Yeah, I have met a few people. Much the same as New England, there is a bit of a &ldquo;locals-only&rdquo; mentality. They get annoyed with tourists, even though the industry of these kind of towns is largely based on tourism.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139224/tumblr-mxmhn2fPsw1qztmmbo1-1280.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 800px;" /></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>What are you trying to show in these pictures? What does it indicate that this one place looks sort of like another?</strong></div>
<div>
  These are things that are familiar to me: photography, New England, and strange suburbia. I am using the aesthetic of photography itself to combine these elements, with City Island as a canvas.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  I have a love-hate relationship with Maine. I like the idea of it. I love it as a place to go for a little bit and come back. They call it Vacationland, and that&rsquo;s accurate. Living there is rough; the winters are really hard.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Yeah, they have to be strong up there. Who are the subjects of the photos?</strong></div>
<div>
  They&rsquo;re my friends, mostly photographers. I like bringing people to this place. It&rsquo;s like a little getaway, and I get to be a tour guide. I create a representation of their experience. Something I have kept in mind while taking the photos is the way a travel brochure looks.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>So you&rsquo;re using your friends as subjects because it makes the photos more interchangeable. You&rsquo;re not trying to say, &ldquo;This is City Island&rdquo;.</strong></div>
<div>
  I want to do more constructing than photographing things that already exist. These pictures are slightly documentary, but I choose particular elements. These are not pictures of one place, but other places too.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139223/corey-olsen-rob-kulisek-2013.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 887px;" /></div>
<div>
  <em>Portrait of Corey Olsen by <a href="http://robkulisek.com/">Rob Kulisek</a>&nbsp;</em></div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>You have a long, braided rat tail. But you work seems to revolve around the way the aesthetic of wholesomeness is constructed by people in New England fishing towns. Please explain.</strong></div>
<div>
  Wholesomeness is an important aspect of the work. I&rsquo;m from Maine, and the aesthetic of Maine resonates with me. I pull influences from L.L. Bean catalogues that I grew up around. In Maine, there is an L.L. Bean store that is open 24/7, 365 days a year. They do not have locks on their doors.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  The photos themselves have an edginess at the same time as looking wholesome. The way this place looks leads people to have expectations about it, and certain elements of the pictures conflict with these expectations.</div>
<div>

My name is Kovvalsky, and I don&rsquo;t feel like a photographer; I just like taking my small camera wherever I go. These photos were taken in Warsaw, my hometown and the capital of Poland. This is the place where I want to live for the rest of my life.<br />
<br />
I have to apologize to all of my friends about publishing these photos, but to me they are the essence of Warsaw. Life in Warsaw just wouldn&#39;t be the same without you guys (and vodka).</p>

<p>
  In the past, when I&#39;ve asked military experts from IHS Jane&#39;s what it would take to conquer, say, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-the-whole-world-could-conquer-the-united-states" target="_blank">America</a>, or <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/we-asked-a-military-expert-if-all-the-worlds-armies-could-shut-down-the-uk" target="_blank">the UK</a>, the idea of its actually happening in the near future was relatively far-fetched. But <a href="http://www.vice.com/vice-news/russian-roulette-the-invasion-of-ukraine-part-1" target="_blank">recent events in Crimea</a> have raised the very real possibility of conflict, so when I asked IHS Jane&#39;s Konrad Muzyka what it would take to conquer Russia, it all suddenly felt very real.</p>
<p>
  No one wants to see Putin riding into battle on the back of a nuclear warhead, but that said, I&#39;d like to make it clear that I, for one, welcome our new Russian overlords and would like to remind them that I could be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground vodka caves.</p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE: I&#39;m going to begin with a classic clich&eacute;. Over the centuries, plenty of power-hungry leaders have tried to take on Russia, convinced that they would be the first to overcome the brutal Russian winter. How could a modern army deal with this ancient problem?</strong><br />
  <strong>Konrad Muzyka: </strong>I agree that from a historical perspective this has been a problem many countries have succumbed to. But the advent of precision guided munitions and, more importantly, nuclear weapons have completely nullified the issue. Any potential conflict with the West would most likely be fought in the air, space, and sea. Any use of land forces would be limited to capturing strategically important facilities&mdash;bridges, airfields, and the like. Given the size of Russian territory, I don&#39;t think anyone would be interested in moving their troops to Russia and holding them there.</p>
<p>
  <strong>So how quickly might any invading force find itself plunged into a nuclear winter?</strong><br />
  Russia reserves the right to use nuclear weapons even in a regional conflict scenario. As such, any country taking on Russia needs to be aware of a dramatic and quick escalation that could take place. But this is a sign of weakness rather than strength.</p>
<p>
  <strong>In the days of the Red Army, it felt as though there was an endless supply of men ready to die in the name of Mother Russia. Is this still true? What&#39;s their manpower like?</strong><br />
  That&#39;s true, but many of those sent into battle during the Second World War fought at gunpoint. Not only that of the Nazi Wehrmacht, but also that of their fellow Russian &quot;comrades.&quot; Retreat was usually forbidden, even in a tactical sense&mdash;those who were caught falling back were either shot on the spot or court-martialed&hellip; and then usually shot.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Not a lot of TLC for the Red Army.</strong><br />
  No. When it comes to their manpower number today, this is a question that I don&#39;t think the Russians themselves can even answer. Armed forces personnel numbers are 1 million, but we estimate that this figure is much, much lower and currently stands at somewhere between 750,000 and 800,000. The army is authorized at nearly 400,000 soldiers, but its actual strength is most likely below 300,000, perhaps as low as 280,000, due to the shortage of draftees and undermanning in certain units.</p>
<p>
  <strong>So, in the event of an invasion, basically Russia would just end up chucking loads of untrained and unwilling civilians back to the frontlines?</strong><br />
  Although efforts have been made in recent years to modernize and restructure the armed forces&mdash;with the ultimate aim of creating a fully professionalized armed forces&mdash;the truth is that in the event of a conflict, Russia will still rely on mass mobilization of its population. What is also interesting to note is that Russia still relies on its railway systems for strategic mobility. Thus, little has changed since the Second World War.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Some things never change. Which brings me to Russia&#39;s size, which has always been a problem for its enemies. There&#39;s just so much territory to cover. Is there any army in the world capable of securing a country this size?</strong><br />
  If I were to give you a short answer, then it would be no. Russia&#39;s territory covers more than one-eighth of the Earth&#39;s inhabited land area and stretches across nine different time zones. There is simply way too much territory to seize and then control. Unless China mobilized half of its population and sent them to cover the wilderness of Siberia.</p>
<p>
  <strong>So what you&#39;re saying is you might be able to conquer Russia if you had half a billion Chinese people marauding across Siberia?</strong><br />
  China would be an interesting case if we considered a conventional conflict scenario. This would turn ugly and most likely develop into a war of attrition. However, with only 143 million people living in Russia, guess who the winner might be... Logistically, though, such an operation is unsustainable, even if the Chinese lived off what they looted, captured, and hunted in Russia. To give you a different perspective, it is estimated that the United States would need 500,000 troops in Afghanistan to secure the whole of the country. Russia is 26 times bigger than Afghanistan and shares borders with 16 countries.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Could a combined EU army take on Russia, or would it have to be a superpower like the US?</strong><br />
  The EU&#39;s military capabilities are&hellip; well, not really existent. Although there are a number of EU battlegroups ready to be deployed abroad, they never have been. I just can&#39;t imagine any EU unified army, if it were ever created, taking on Russia. As I mentioned previously, any conflict with NATO countries or China would most likely involve nuclear weapons, which would, in turn, lead to mutually assured destruction (MAD).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Has there been much of a shift in relative military power between the US and Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union? And has Putin made Russia more powerful militarily in recent years?</strong><br />
  Yes, there definitely has been. Whereas the US has reaffirmed its doctrine based on tri-service [army, navy, air force] interoperability coupled with investment into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4ISR" target="_blank">C4ISR platforms</a> [computers and surveillance, basically], there had been no serious efforts to do the same in Russia, at least until 2008.</p>
<p>
  The short conflict with Georgia in August 2008, which was also called the last war of the 21st century, showed that in terms of wider military capabilities Russia was years, if not decades, behind the US. When, in 2008, the US could easily deploy a significant number of UAVs [drones] over Afghanistan and Iraq, Russian UAVs used in Georgia were reportedly so loud that they could be heard from miles away. As you can imagine, the quality of imagery delivered was not great either. As a result, Russian UAVs were declared useless.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140167/Screen-Shot-2014-03-03-at-5-59-04-PM-vice-640x360.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
  <em style="font-size: 12px;">A Ukrainian woman tries to talk to a Russian special forces agent in Crimea.</em></p>
<p>
  <strong>So the decision to get involved in that tiff with Georgia could have backfired on Putin? </strong><br />
  In a way... It became clear that Russian armed forces needed bigger investment and that the country&#39;s defense industry was unable to match Western-produced equipment. To an extent this was rectified by the procurement of UAVs from Israel, amphibious vessels from France, and multipurpose vehicles from Italy. Although, for various reasons, Russia decided to stop importing foreign military equipment.</p>
<p>
  <strong>So where does all that leave them?</strong><br />
  A military reform that followed in the immediate aftermath of August 2008 is seeking to introduce new quality, both in terms of equipment and leadership, to Russia&#39;s armed forces and completely transform them into a modern, agile, and easily deployable fighting force. It looks nice on paper, but the reality is that they&#39;re still unable to deliver top-notch equipment. Delays pile up, corruption is still a significant problem, hazing among personnel is prevalent, and the troops are poorly trained.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Moving on, how could you neutralize Russia&#39;s nuclear capability?</strong><br />
  You can&#39;t. Russia possesses second-strike capability, and unless you&#39;re ready to take a nuclear hit from Russia&mdash;which no one can&mdash;you need to embrace the notion of a total annihilation of your country.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Right.</strong><br />
  It is estimated that Russia possesses around 4,300 nuclear warheads. Another 700 strategic and 2,000 non-strategic warheads are in storage. Just like in the case of the US, Russian deterrence is based on a triad of systems [land, air, and sea]. Even if you knocked out the land and air delivery systems/platforms, submarines fitted with nuclear ICBMs would be virtually undetectable once they&#39;d left Russian ports.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Apart from that, where do Russia&#39;s military strengths lie? Should we be worried about the navy?</strong><br />
  Russia has never been a maritime power. Its navy relies on a small number of major combatants to support its commitment to exercises, counter-piracy patrols, and global presence missions. The newest major surface combatant is more than 20 years old. The average age of Russia&#39;s large surface combatants, even excluding the two oldest vessels, is 27 years. Its sole aircraft carrier, <em>Admiral Kuznetsov</em>, was commissioned in 1990 and requires modernization, which is planned to take place by the end of the decade. This means that Russia will lose a significant part of its power-projection capability for two to four years. There are plans to build a fleet of carriers but Russia is not expected to commence work on the program until 2025 at the earliest.</p>
<p>
  <strong>And its air force?</strong><br />
  In general, it&#39;s much better than the Russian Navy. A number of new aircraft is introduced to the service each year. Some of them&mdash;the Su-35, for example&mdash;are comparable to the F-22. Some would even argue that some of the Su-35&#39;s characteristics, especially its maneuverability, are better than those of Western aircraft, including the F-22 and the F-35.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Obviously Russia is flexing its muscles in Crimea at the moment. Does it have a lot of military bases along the Ukrainian border?</strong><br />
  Russia leases a naval military base in Sevastopol, in Crimea. Its Black Sea Fleet comprises about 20 to 40 vessels, including frigates, destroyers, and corvettes. This also included approximately 15,000 personnel. I say &quot;included&quot; because, in the last few days, Russia has deployed another 16,000 troops to the peninsula. The core of the force is based around the 7th Guards Airborne Division. These guys are not to be played with. They have been used in various operations across Europe, including the suppression of the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian revolutions. More recently, they were stationed in the Caucasus, fighting Chechens.</p>
<p>
  Apart from that, Russia has deployed strategic airlift aircraft to Crimea and seized communication and air-traffic control centers, as well as airports. The center of political power in Crimea has also been captured. This presents a textbook case of how one can start an invasion. However, with 31,000 troops on the ground, Russia would find it hard to move north to eastern Ukraine. As such, Russia would need to open a second front in Eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>
  To sum up, as far as Ukraine goes, Russia exports gas, oil, and fear.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Where would you begin an invasion of Russia and where would you go from there? I&#39;m thinking surprise attack on Archangel [a city in the northwest of Russia, near Finland] and then move south with stealth and precision. That way, it gets warmer, not colder.</strong><br />
  Let&#39;s discuss this as a conventional conflict scenario. The quick answer to your question is&hellip; anywhere. Russian borders are indefensible. Wherever you look at the map there are no natural obstacles that would hamper a military advance. Historically, every major advance that threatened Russia&#39;s existence (the Poles in 1610, Napoleon in 1812, Hitler in 1941) came from the Northern European Plain. This is why Stalin was so keen on seizing Central Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War and why Putin has called the collapse of the Soviet Union &quot;the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.&quot; Russia has lost a lot of its strategic depth since 1991 and now it could potentially lose Ukraine.</p>
<p>
  Even if you started an invasion from Poland and the Baltic states, the front would be so large that Russia would either need to pray for snow and freezing temperatures or send millions of its citizens to fight. A combination of both would be preferable.</p>
<p>
  <strong>And finally, if our imagined army took control of most of Russia, where would the natives locate their efforts of guerrilla resistance? In this vast land, what would be the hardest places for an invading army to secure?</strong><br />
  Immense land masses of central Russia would offer ample places to wage effective Daniel-Craig-in-<em>Defiance</em>-style insurgency campaigns. I can&#39;t also exclude Stalingrad-style urban campaigns. But as I have mentioned, this is unlikely to happen. You couldn&#39;t really live, let alone fight, in the nuclear wasteland that Russia would be turned into in the event of a conflict with China or the US.</p>
<p>

<title>Prison Guard Mark Williams Has to Choose Between His Job and His Dreadlocks</title>

<p class="photo_caption">
  <i>Mark Williams in his uniform</i></p>
<p>
  About two weeks ago, a sergeant approached Mark Williams, a correctional officer at the California Institution for Men, in Chino, and told him he had to choose between his dreadlocks and his job. For 14 years Mark has supervised inmates&mdash;checked their mail, given them soap, watched them eat breakfast and work out in the Yard, driven them to radiation-treatment centers, and covered their vocation release. All the while, he kept his dreadlocks in a bun, to keep them above his collar.</p>
<p>
  According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation manual, &ldquo;Female employees&#39; hair shall not extend below the bottom of the collar. If the hair is long, it shall be worn in a neat, non-flamboyant style.&rdquo; But the bun rule only applies to female employees.</p>
<p>
  Mark is not the only prison guard to be let go over his long dreadlocks. Last fall, Richard Williams, a probation officer in Atlanta, was fired from the Georgia Department of Corrections for not cutting his locks. Solomon Stanley, an ex-prison guard of Visalia, California, currently has a workplace suit in the state court and a civil-rights suit in federal court for being harassed over his dreadlocks and beard.</p>
<p>
  Mark and these other men all claim to practice Nazarene beliefs, a sect of Christianity that requires its followers to let their hair grow, untamed.</p>
<p>
  Mark has grown his dreads since 2008. He doesn&rsquo;t futz with them much, just sprays and conditions them. All he wants is to work and grow his hair. What else could a man ask for?</p>
<p>
  It&rsquo;s not totally clear whether Mark&rsquo;s religious beliefs run very deep or he just wants to keep his cool hairstyle. I called him up to get some answers.</p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE: When were you told that you needed to cut your hair?</strong><br />
  <strong>Mark Williams:</strong> This all started about two years ago. Basically, there has always been talk from friends around the office about my hair, and that some supervisors couldn&rsquo;t wait to write me up for it.</p>
<p>
  I typically wear a baseball hat to work, an approved departmental visor. A sergeant was in the office with three other sergeants and a lieutenant, and he asked me, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with that female hat you&rsquo;re wearing?&rdquo; I told him I didn&rsquo;t appreciate his comment&mdash;he was being unprofessional and out of line for confronting me in front of inmates and my peers.</p>
<p>
  To me, that&rsquo;s like asking if I&rsquo;m gay. Why do you need to ask me if it&rsquo;s a female hat? And from that, I filed for harassment. The issue went away for a while, because management stepped in.</p>
<p>
  <strong>And recently?</strong><br />
  Let&rsquo;s fast-forward to February 13,<sup>&nbsp;</sup>2014. I was sitting at my work station when I was approached by a correctional sergeant and lieutenant. They told me that a directive came from the captain&rsquo;s office&mdash;if I did not cut my hair, then I would receive an ETR complaint, which is like a verbal version of a written complaint. That would lead to progressive disciplinary action, which leads to termination.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Why do you think that happened?</strong><br />
  Whenever you get a new warden or a new captain&mdash;a new supervisor who transfers in from somewhere else&mdash;they want to push the line on certain things. This could very well have been a situation where we had a new warden who happened to see me and he didn&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>
  If there are women who have dreadlocks and I&rsquo;m a male with dreadlocks, what&rsquo;s the difference? There was a male officer who was Steve and who wanted to become Stephanie, and they created a restroom to accommodate her.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Who is Stephanie? How did that all go down?</strong><br />
  Steve was a correctional peace officer in the late 80s or early 90s&mdash;he was a counselor for the inmates. He wanted to become a woman, and he asked for a reasonable accommodation to fit his needs, and they obliged.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Right. Would you say your dreads are connected to your Nazarene religious practice?</strong><br />
  Absolutely. It&rsquo;s what I believe in and what I stand for. It&rsquo;s my spiritual belief. I feel like I have a purpose to make a difference in the lives of others and spread the love that I have within me. I&rsquo;m not cutting my hair, and scripture supports that.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
  <i>Mark&#39;s coworkers discussing his hair on Facebook</i></p>
<p>
  <strong>So have they dismissed you?</strong><br />
  No, I haven&rsquo;t been dismissed. Technically, I&rsquo;m off due to stress and for creating a discriminatory environment. Now that this has gone public, my coworkers have been discussing it all over social media. I don&rsquo;t know who is for or against me anymore.</p>
<p>
  All I ask for is understanding. It&rsquo;s a matter of perception and consideration. I&rsquo;ve worked as a correctional officer there for 14 years, and I&rsquo;ve never been written up. But over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been a target of discrimination and harassment. I want to put a stop to it.</p>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
Russia has invaded the Crimean peninsula of Ukraine and taken over its civilian and military infrastructure. Not a shot has been fired so far, but Russia is using its superior force to intimidate Ukrainian troops in an attempt to get them to surrender.<br />
<br />
Russia claims it wants to stabilize the situation on the peninsula, which has a large Russian population, but Ukraine&#39;s new government regards the move as an occupation of its sovereign territory.</p>

<title>Bad Cop Blotter: Police Chief Doesn’t Know You Can’t OD on Pot</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/police-chief-doesnt-know-you-cant-od-on-pot</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 22:35:00 +0000</pubDate>

<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140078/I-had-a-friend-who-smoked-pot-now-hes-dead.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 427px;" /></p>
<p>
  <i>Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quinnanya/" target="_blank">Quinn Dombrowski</a></i></p>
<p>
  Last Tuesday, during a hearing on legislation that would permit the use of recreational marijuana in Maryland, <a href="http://www.capitalgazette.com/blogs/under_the_dome/annapolis-police-chief-cites-hoax-story-in-opposition-to-marijuana/article_97c304e5-b485-5981-9197-9b5f9f5f97e7.html" target="_blank">Annapolis police chief Michael Pristoop testified against the bill</a>, in the process claiming that 37 people had overdosed on marijuana the day that pot became legal in Colorado. Pristoop was apparently getting his information from the Daily Currant, a notoriously shitty, unfunny &ldquo;satire&rdquo; website that put up a joke piece that <a href="http://dailycurrant.com/2014/01/02/marijuana-overdoses-kill-37-in-colorado-on-first-day-of-legalization/" target="_blank">&ldquo;reported&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;that those people had died back in January.</p>
<p>
  State senator Jamie Raskin, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, immediately corrected Pristoop and told him that the Daily Currant is a comedy site. Pristoop said he would check on the error, but he was &ldquo;holding on to information I was provided.&rdquo; The next day Pristoop acknowledged he was wrong but said the general objection to legalization still stands. In other words, his opinion was based on lies, but he wasn&#39;t changing it.</p>
<p>
  Now, Pristoop&rsquo;s job requires that he enforce the drug laws, which in theory means that he should be more educated than the general public about what individual drugs can and can&rsquo;t do. What&rsquo;s disturbing is that he believed such a baseless story on faith&mdash;believed it enough to bring it up in a fancy hearing!&mdash;even though <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/nope-still-no-such-thing-as-a-fatal-marijuana-overdose" target="_blank">YOU CAN&rsquo;T OVERDOSE ON MARIJUANA</a>.</p>
<p>
  Depending on the circumstances, enforcers of drug laws may or may not acknowledge that there is a significant difference between drugs, even drugs placed in the same legal categories. The DEA may put marijuana <a href="http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/" target="_blank">in the same schedule</a>&nbsp;as heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and other scary substances, but if you have some <a href="http://www.justice.gov/dea/careers/drug-policy.shtml" target="_blank">&ldquo;limited youthful and experimental use of marijuana&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;you can still become a DEA employee&mdash;suggesting that the agency knows smoking weed is not that big of a deal. Yet you still have Michele Leonhart, the head of the DEA, criticizing President Obama&rsquo;s honesty <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobsullum/2014/01/27/dea-head-criticizes-obama-for-telling-the-truth-about-marijuana/" target="_blank">when he said alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana.</a>&nbsp;(She has also previously refused to answer questions about how dangerous pot is compared to meth, heroin, or other drugs.)</p>
<p>
  The general population and <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/politicians-finally-realize-they-can-stop-pretending-to-hate-weed" target="_blank">even some politicians</a>&nbsp;are changing their attitudes toward marijuana&mdash;Colorado and Washington were the trendsetters when it came to recreational weed, and other states seem keen to follow. But we&rsquo;ve still got a lot of holdouts like Leonhart and Pristoop, old-school drug warriors whose livelihoods are so closely tied to prohibition policies that they&rsquo;ll say anything to keep marijuana illegal, even if they look incredibly stupid saying it.</p>
<p>
  Here are the rest of this week&rsquo;s bad cops:</p>
<p>
  &ndash;On February 27, author and entrepreneur Peter Shankman was ticketed by the New York Police Department for going jogging in Central Park at 4:30 in the morning. Shankman tweeted a picture of the summons he received and ranted on Facebook about the incident&mdash;according to him, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2014/02/28/ceo_ticketed_for_running_in_central.php" target="_blank">a police officer told him the park didn&rsquo;t open until 6 AM</a>, and since the cop&#39;s boss was with him, he had to write the ticket. Arguably, there is a logic to closing a city park at night in order to discourage crime and loitering. But this ticket is a perfect demonstration of a society and city where cops are involved in daily life to such an extent that even when someone is harmlessly breaking the letter of the law&mdash;Shankman is training for an Ironman event and doesn&rsquo;t have time to run in the park when it&rsquo;s open&mdash;they get penalized by the system. Luckily for Shankman, he&rsquo;s wealthy enough to fight the summons in court, or presumably pay the fine if he loses his case.</p>
<p>
  &ndash;At the Photography Is Not a Crime blog, <a href="http://photographyisnotacrime.com/2014/02/27/cops-now-reaching-guns-citizens-video-record/" target="_blank">Carlos Miller recently noted several new Youtube videos</a>&nbsp;that seem to show cops pulling guns on people who refuse to stop filming police. Miller&rsquo;s entire blog is devoted to the cataloguing cops who arrest or intimidate citizens (including <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130124/11100921780/carlos-miller-arrested-again-perfectly-legal-photography.shtml" target="_blank">Miller himself</a>) who film them. It&rsquo;s legal to take photos in public and cops should have nothing to hide&mdash;there&rsquo;s no reason for officers to <em>draw their guns</em> on people who are armed only with a camera. Considering the <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/shot-for-holding-a-wii-remote" target="_blank">long history of police</a>&nbsp;shooting folks holding wallets or reaching for waistbands, it&rsquo;s perhaps a pleasant surprise that we haven&rsquo;t heard of more people getting injured, or worse, because they decided to film the cops.</p>
<p>
  &ndash;Speaking of the police&rsquo;s inability to identify whether something is a weapon, on February 28 <a href="http://www.greenvilleonline.com/viewart/20140227/NEWS06/302270049/Deputy-shoots-70-year-old-man-reaching-cane-during-traffic-stop" target="_blank">a sheriff&rsquo;s deputy in South Carolina shot a disabled 70-year-old man</a>&nbsp;after he reached for his cane during a traffic stop. York County deputy Terrence Knox stopped Bobby Canipe on Tuesday evening over an expired tag, and when Canipe reached into the back of his pickup for his cane, Knox reportedly thought Canipe was reaching for a rifle, so he fired multiple shots and hit Canipe once (he&rsquo;s not even a good shot, apparently). The senior citizen is expected to recover while Knox is on paid leave as the shooting is investigated. York County Police spokesperson Trent Faris expressed regret over the incident but said that, for now, it appeared that Knox&rsquo;s shots were an &ldquo;appropriate response to what he reasonably believed to be an imminent threat to his life.&rdquo; Reasonable by law-enforcement standards, maybe, but that&rsquo;s not all that high&mdash;if an ordinary citizen shot an unarmed old man, he&rsquo;d be in jail right now.</p>
<p>
  &ndash;On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/in-arizona-project-rose-is-arresting-sex-workers-to-save-them" target="_blank">VICE columnist Molly Crabapple reported</a>&nbsp;on Phoenix&rsquo;s paternalistic anti&ndash;sex worker program Project ROSE. Crabapple noted that sex workers in the city are often picked up in police stings, put in cuffs, and taken to Bethany Bible Church in order to be encouraged to take part in this program instead of going to prison. Prosecutors and cops are present, as are representatives from the project. Hundreds of individuals aren&rsquo;t given the chance to talk to legal representation, yet the Phoenix Police Department&rsquo;s spin is that the whole program is &ldquo;voluntary.&rdquo; According to Crabapple, 30 percent of all enrollees in Project ROSE complete the program. It may be better than prison, but, as Crabapple writes, ROSE&rsquo;s &ldquo;raids funnel hundreds of people into the criminal justice system. Denied access to lawyers, many of these people are coerced into ROSE&#39;s program without being convicted of any crime.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not good.</p>
<p>
  &ndash;Two police officers in Midland, Texas, have been suspended for three days after an internal investigation showed that they had made a game out of stealing signs belonging to homeless people. <a href="http://www.alternet.org/texas-cops-compete-steal-homeless-peoples-signs-fun" target="_blank">Officers Derek Hester and Daniel Zoelzer took at least 18 signs</a>&nbsp;and threw away ten of them. They initially tried to claim that the signs had been taken from people who had been ticketed for trespassing, but that didn&rsquo;t mesh with police records. Hester&rsquo;s refusal to turn in some brass knuckles procured as evidence first prompted the investigation into the officers&rsquo; super fun, not-at-all-awful game. Texts between Hester and Zoelzer expressed worry about being caught, though one message said, &ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t care lol I&rsquo;m not worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  &ndash;In response to an increase in prescription drug overdoses (as well as a potentially related <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/legalize-heroin" target="_blank">uptick in heroin use</a>), <a href="http://www.thebradentontimes.com/news/2014/03/03/state_government/buchanan_praises_dea_decision_on_painkillers/#.UxQvSUtX_Ww" target="_blank">last week the DEA</a>&nbsp;continued plans to make it harder for people to get hydrocodone painkillers, the most popular of which is Vicodin. Florida congressman Vern Buchanan, who co-sponsored legislation to make this move last year, said this meant &ldquo;we are one step closer to curbing the abuse of the deadly narcotics wreaking havoc on countless families and communities across our nation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s tempting to think so, and drug overdoses are a serious problem, but giving the DEA more powers to police what individuals put into their bodies, or what doctors may prescribe to their patients, is not the solution. Particularly not in a world where many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.creators.com/opinion/jacob-sullum/drug-control-vs-pain-control-a-crackdown-on-opioid-prescriptions-will-hurt-patients.html" target="_blank">chronic pain sufferers</a>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t get the medication they need.</p>
<p>
  &ndash;Our Good Cop of the Week is Duval County, Florida, school-resource officer Joe Richardson for his small act of kindness toward a stranger. Recently, a woman named <a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/consumer/on-your-side/2014/02/26/officer-pays-stranger-medication/5842777/" target="_blank">Karen Susman was at a Jacksonville Walgreens</a>&nbsp;when she learned that, thanks to changes in her insurance, the copay for an antibiotic she needed was $72, which she couldn&rsquo;t afford. She seemed to be out of luck until Richardson stepped in and bought her the medicine. Random generosity like this is made for forwarded emails from soppy old people, but it is also touching as hell and is an effective inoculation against misanthropy&mdash;and a reminder that police officers can be kind, decent people.</p>

<p>
  <em>Medina Jabal Town, Fort Irwin, CA</em>, 2009</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://clairebeckett.com/">Claire Beckett</a> is an American photographer and anthropologist. She worked as a Peace Corps volunteer in Benin and now photographs American military training camps and young recruits, as well as Americans who have converted to Islam. Her photographs humbly confront the hypocrisies of the established attitudes toward her subjects. We asked her about the tensions present in the work and within the subjects she photographed.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
  <strong><em>Mossless</em>: You were a member of the Peace Corps in West Africa about ten years ago, before you went on to study photography. Did something during your time there compel you to start shooting photographs?</strong></div>
<div>
  <strong>Claire Beckett: </strong>I&rsquo;ve actually been photographing since I was 16 years old, though I didn&rsquo;t decide to make photography my life until after my Peace Corps experience. Going into Peace Corps, I was unsure of what to do career-wise, and I&rsquo;d thought of continuing on with anthropology&mdash;which I&rsquo;d studied as an undergrad&mdash;or perhaps working in humanitarian relief. As a volunteer in Benin, I worked as a public health educator, focusing on HIV/AIDS education, malaria prevention, and girls&rsquo; empowerment. Living in Benin proved to be very clarifying. Being so far from home and so immersed in the host culture, I gained a new perspective on both myself and my home country. While in Benin I also did a lot of photography and had an abundance of time to think, read and write. &nbsp;After a while I just realized that being an artist was the most personally meaningful thing that I could do. &nbsp;</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>You have three main projects on your website, and they are all relevant to one another. Let&rsquo;s begin with your photographs about young soldiers in your series, <em>In Training</em>. What are they going through?</strong></div>
<div>
  The soldiers that I photographed for <em>In Training</em> were all newly enlisted and had yet to be deployed to a war zone. The photographs were made from 2004 to 2007, during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it was likely that many of these soldiers would see combat. I focused on the time between enlistment and deployment, with an emphasis on Basic Training, because I was fascinated by the transformation of young people from civilian teenagers to fully trained soldiers. These soldiers were learning the vocation of soldiering, but they were also being shaped by the culture of the Army. &nbsp;I particularly enjoyed seeing the very young and very green soldiers because they would behave in ways that no seasoned veteran ever would. For example, I remember one soldier who was still in high school, whom I met while he was participating in a pre&ndash;Basic Training exercise with the National Guard (older teens can join the National Guard in a provisional way with a guardian&rsquo;s consent). This young man was wearing an armful of colorful rubber bracelets along with his uniform. &nbsp;Of course rubber bracelets are not part of the Army uniform, and it is actually forbidden to wear them. I knew that if I ever saw this soldier again he would be totally transformed by his training and, potentially, by fighting in a war. The bracelets would be gone, and a much more profound change would have taken place, on the inside.</div>

<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>In <em>Simulating Iraq</em>, American soldiers and civilians play the roles of Iraqi insurgents and civilians, for training purposes. Did you ever ask the participants how they felt about the roles they were playing?</strong></div>
<div>
  Yes, I often asked participants about what they thought of their roles. I was fascinated to find that most participants absolutely relished the roles that they played. For some, it seemed like a case of playacting, like high school theater wrought on a grander scale. For others, there was a fascination with Arab culture and language. I was surprised to learn at one facility that the female civilian roleplayers were spending their own money to purchase fancy Arab-style clothing on the internet. I think that it made them feel glamorous. Among the soldiers there often seemed to be a bias towards playing the &ldquo;bad guys,&rdquo; typically identified as &ldquo;jihadis&rdquo; or &ldquo;terrorists,&rdquo; because it was exciting. The bad guys generally ran amok, used unique weaponry, and got to blow things up. Of course, I am generalizing, but this is the spirit of things that I observed.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>How large are these training grounds? Are they used frequently?</strong></div>
<div>
  The training facilities are huge. Fort Irwin in California&rsquo;s Mojave Desert, where I made a lot of this work, has approximately 1,000 square miles of training grounds, and the Marine Corp&rsquo;s Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, California is of a similar size. For perspective, the state of Rhode Island is very close in size at 1,033 square miles. And yes, when I was photographing, they were used very frequently. The bases as a whole were in continuous use, and I observed the simulated villages to be in use about 50 percent of the time. Of course, that could have changed now with the winding down of the wars.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>

<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>You&rsquo;ve also photographed Americans who&rsquo;ve converted to Islam. Is there a personal link to this?&nbsp;It must be incredibly difficult for some converts (as you&rsquo;ve put it in your statement) to traverse the imagined line between the supposedly diametrical opposites &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; and &ldquo;American.&rdquo; What was a particularly notable experience you heard from one of your participants?</strong></div>
<div>
  My interest in <em>The Converts</em> does not come from a direct personal connection to the subject matter in the sense that I am not a Muslim convert and, prior to embarking on this project, I did not personally know any converts. The project stems largely, I think, from what I observed of the way that Muslims (or &ldquo;Muslim-looking&rdquo; people, if there is such a thing) were treated in the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. I was in my early 20s at the time, and seeing the bigotry and hatred directed at Muslims really caught my attention. It took me a long time to figure out how to deal with these ideas in my work, and it wasn&rsquo;t until I&rsquo;d had a series of other experiences with Muslims, including living in a mixed Christian/Animist/Muslim community in Benin, that I was more ready to grapple with the subject. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  In terms of the experiences of the participants in my project, I&rsquo;m struck over and over again by stories of how converts relate to their birth families. I know one heartbreaking situation of a family who has completed rejected their daughter as a result of her faith. This experience is so painful for her because she loves her family and wants to maintain ties with them. On the other hand, I know a family that was initially shocked by the daughter&rsquo;s decision to become Muslim but eventually came to warmly accept her and her Muslim husband. Now the convert&rsquo;s mother goes out of her way to purchase a Halal (Islamically permissible) turkey for Thanksgiving so that the Muslim family members can be included in the meal.</div>

<title>A Biotech Company Has Developed a GMO Apple That Doesn&#039;t Brown</title>

<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139999/apple.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
  <i>Photo via Flickr user <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/104611998@N08/10138854315/" target="_blank">Flinqr</a></i></p>
<p class="p1">
  I don&rsquo;t think that most people are all that concerned about an apple that&rsquo;s a little bit brown. After you cut up some apple slices and leave them out for a few minutes in the open air, the fruit begins to oxidize&mdash;it&rsquo;s part of nature, and we understand that it tastes just as good. If that&#39;s how you feel, then <a href="http://www.okspecialtyfruits.com/">Okanagan Specialty Fruits</a> isn&rsquo;t interested in you as a customer. The British Columbia&ndash;based fruit grower has developed the so-called <a href="http://www.arcticapples.com/">Arctic Apple</a>, the first non-oxidizing apple. And the genetically modified fruit&mdash;spliced with an antibiotic gene called Kanamycin&mdash;is stirring up nearly as much controversy as Eve&rsquo;s apple.</p>
<p class="p1">
  &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all on the same page. We are not in support of this apple,&rdquo; said Jim Allen, president of the <a href="http://www.nyapplecountry.com/">New York Apple Association</a>, of growers&rsquo; sentiment. &ldquo;As an industry, we have been able to say forever that apples are not GM [genetically modified]. We have never crossed that line, and we don&rsquo;t want to do so now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p1">
  Allen said he worried that genetically modified apples might topple the already struggling North American apple-export market. That&rsquo;s because Europe has much stricter food-safety regulations than the US; as a result, the EU has already slashed its import of US grown apples, objecting to American growers&rsquo; use of waxes (to make the apples shiny) and certain chemicals that prevent &ldquo;scald,&rdquo; a variety of conditions that blemish the apples but don&rsquo;t affect their taste. US apple exports to Europe dropped by 73 percent between 2006 and 2012, causing New York senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand to <a call="" eu="" href="http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/schumer-gillibrand-push-new-york-apple-pear-exports-to-eu" import="" its="" p="" reconsider="" the="" to="" upon=""> </a></p>
<p class="p1">
  Adding a genetically modified apple to the mix could be the final bullet to the already floundering apple-export industry. The EU has strict regulations on which GM crops it will import; crops containing &ldquo;antibiotic marker genes,&rdquo; like the one used by Arctic Apples, are <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0018:EN:HTML" target="_blank">a&nbsp;<span class="s1">strict no-go as of 2004</span></a>. If they&rsquo;re approved by the FDA, the USDA, and their Canadian counterparts&mdash;as seems likely by later this year&mdash;Arctic Apples would be the only GM apple on the market. But traditional apple growers fear that their fruit trees could become cross-pollinated with Arctic Apples, a phenomenon that has plagued farmers&mdash;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Monsanto+Defeats+Small+Farmers+in+Critical+Bioethics+Class+Action+Suit/article24118.htm"><span class="s1">produced many lawsuits</span></a>&mdash;since the mid 90s, when genetically modified crops began to be widely planted. And if traditional apples do get cross-pollinated&mdash;or if the EU even fears that they might&mdash;exports could drop even lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
  &ldquo;We do depend on exports tremendously, and the EU is deaf on GMOs,&rdquo; Allen said. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">
  The makers of Arctic Apples insist that cross-pollination is not an issue. &ldquo;Growing an Arctic orchard next to a conventional orchard is akin to growing Galas next to Granny Smiths&mdash;they don&rsquo;t become each other,&rdquo; said Neal Carter, president of Okanagan Specialty Fruits. &ldquo;Similarly, Arctic apples will not make neighboring orchards &lsquo;GMO.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="p3">
  Because apple blossoms are pollinated by bees and not by wind, Carter said, the risk of bee visits between orchards is minimal. &ldquo;Bees typically stay close to the hive when ample food is present, such as in an orchard in bloom, and their movement is further restricted among dense plantings common in apple orchards,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
  Allen doesn&rsquo;t buy that argument. &ldquo;There&nbsp;<i>would</i>&nbsp;be cross-pollination,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p3">
  The issue won&rsquo;t be settled for a few more years. Although Arctic Apples will likely soon receive commercial approval, it will take time to convince apple growers to take a risk on producing them, given&nbsp;<a href="http://news.nationalgeogr/"><span class="s1">general consumer distrust</span></a>&nbsp;of GM foods. And such a gamble would be a pricey one, with orchard land going for about $15,000&ndash;$20,000 per acre, according to Allen. Once the Arctic orchards do get planted, it will take years for the trees to reach maturity and produce fruit.</p>
<p class="p3">
  Until then, we&rsquo;ll just have to dream about all the possibilities of an apple that doesn&rsquo;t brown. Or just eat an oxidized regular apple and go about our daily lives.</p>

<title>American Car Ads Are an Embarrassment</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/american-car-ads-are-a-fucking-embarrassment</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 20:19:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
During the Oscars last night, Cadillac aired their controversial new &quot;American exceptionalism&quot; commercial, which originally premiered during the Winter Olympics. It features actor and devout Catholic, Neal McDonough, perfectly cast as &ldquo;Arrogant American Asshole,&rdquo; shitting on the rest of the lazy world. It is one of the worst car ads ever produced.</p>
<p>
  Even if you know nothing about ad agency culture, you know by watching <em>Mad Men</em> that an auto account is the ultimate win&mdash;the marquee piece of business to have on your reel. The advertising revolution of the 1960s was ignited by car ads&mdash;specifically the great <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/copyranter/all-the-great-1960s-volkswagen-ads">Doyle Dane Bernbach work on Volkswage</a><u>n</u>. This might lead you to think, due to the intense competition, that the resulting car ads would be brilliant works of art. But the ads&mdash;at least in America&mdash;are actually fucking awful, nearly across the board.</p>
<p>
  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qGJSI48gkFc" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
  <strong>Cadillac ELR: &ldquo;Poolside&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>
  This commercial has already gotten some press: Liberals <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/26/this-commercial-sums-up-e_n_4859040.html">hate it</a>; conservatives <a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/3204489936001/inspiring-vs-insulting-new-cadillac-ad-sparks-debate/#sp=show-clips">love it</a>. Me? I&rsquo;m a libertarian, so I don&rsquo;t give a shit about the politics expressed in a car ad. But what&rsquo;s the ad selling? Amurica. And, oh yeah, there&rsquo;s a car in the spot&mdash;a Commie electric car that costs $75,000. While McDonough is busy bashing France with his juvenile speech, Cadillac forgets to sell me on the fucking car. <em>N&#39;est-ce pas</em>, dumbasses?</p>
<p>
  Cadillac&rsquo;s advertising director Craig Bierley says people have &ldquo;misconstrued&rdquo; the ad (in other words, he&rsquo;s calling you consumers stupid). Here&rsquo;s some of his <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/craig-bierley/5/552/202">MBA-fueled </a>bullshit <a href="http://adage.com/article/news/cadillac-clears-misconceptions-poolside-ad/291925/">defending the spot</a>:</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;It&#39;s basically saying hard work creates its own luck. In order to achieve it, you just have to believe anything&#39;s possible. You have to believe in yourself; you have to believe in possibilities. It&#39;s really about optimism. It&#39;s really a fundamental human truth: optimism about creating your own future. It&#39;s not about materialism.&quot;</p>
<p>
  NO, not at all.</p>
<p>
  Ad agency: Rogue, which is a new shop with a cool name that is really just a bunch of existing Interpublic agency employees thrown together specifically to win the Cadillac account (about $250 million, annually).</p>
<p>
  Wardrobe note: McDounough&rsquo;s suit was one size too tight.</p>
<p>
  <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KlSn8Isv-3M" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
  <strong>Chrysler: &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Import&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>
  Here&rsquo;s another ad selling me on my country, and not cars, starring a hooey-spouting Bob Dylan. The spot, which first aired during the Super Bowl, is an American tragedy that somebody needs to maybe write a folk song about.</p>
<p>
  Many critics missed the point: It&rsquo;s not Bob Dylan that made this ad so awful&mdash;using him could have made for an interesting commercial. No, it&rsquo;s how he was used: as a doddering prop, saying a copywriter&rsquo;s flat, uninspired, disjointed words, words nothing like Dylan&rsquo;s lyrics. &quot;What&rsquo;s more American than America?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; is pretty damn American.</p>
<p>
  The spot is a bunch of copy bites&mdash;&quot;You can&rsquo;t fake true cool&quot; (<em>what?</em>)&mdash;a patchwork of over-the-top, incoherent, sloppily stitched-together images of &quot;Americana.&quot; Cowboys. Cheerleaders. Dr. J. Rosie the Riveter tattoo. Rosie the Riveter poster (in case you missed the tattoo). Woman with child. Vintage woman with child. Close-up of hot girl with blowjob lips. Back to the cowboy (NEEDS MORE COWBOY), etc. And since a lot Americans weren&rsquo;t going to know who the fuck this slow-speaking old man was, let&rsquo;s slip in a shot of Dylan staring at his own music books. Fucking fan-tastic.</p>
<p>
  And then, just like Cadillac, let&rsquo;s throw in some Cold War&ndash;era, junior-high-school-term-paper-level jingoism:</p>
<p>
  &quot;So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone...&quot; Yeah, and let Fiat wholly own your &quot;American&quot; car company. It&rsquo;s just embarrassingly bad ad copy. I apologize, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-greatest-american-copywriter-wasnt-a-mad-man">Tom McElligott</a>. I apologize, Bill Bernbach&rsquo;s ghost.</p>
<p>
  Ad agency: GlobalHue, whose homepage copywriter (the same one?) says that the firm has &quot;<a href="http://www.globalhue.com/">deep expertise in activating influence</a>.&quot;</p>

  <strong>Jeep: &ldquo;Restless&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>
  This is the last one for today, because I can&rsquo;t take this shit anymore.</p>
<p>
  The spot&mdash;which sounds like it was written by an account executive who thinks he&rsquo;s the sober reincarnation of Jack Kerouac&mdash;also first aired during the Super Bowl. It also sounds like the voiceover dude just got out of bed at 2 PM and is practicing the script in the bathroom mirror. Some of the rubbish copy:</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Restlessness starts with an itch, and ends in progress.&rdquo; <em>Progress</em>? What the fuck are you talking about, sleepy millennial dude?</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Genetics have a voice&quot;&mdash;no, they don&rsquo;t&mdash;&quot;you can only deny so long. They scream&quot;&mdash;no, they don&rsquo;t&mdash;&quot;&lsquo;go, run, act, find, dare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  &quot;Each tick of the old clock... a reminder that stillness is what actually kills us.&rdquo; No, most of the times it&rsquo;s genetics; and occasionally it&#39;s from getting hit by a Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>
  Closing request: Would all you ambitious, young copywriters currently on American car accounts <em>please</em> quit your jobs and go finish your shitty American novel so you can get all these shitty turns of phrases out of your system? Then come back to ad-agency life and start writing real, good ads. Thank you.</p>

<title>Roger Ballen&#039;s &#039;Asylum of the Birds&#039;</title>

<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  For the first time in the half century Roger Ballen has been making photographs, he&rsquo;s allowing his audience an intimate walk through his world with him. The new documentary short &ldquo;Asylum of the Birds,&rdquo; directed by &nbsp;Ben Crossman, depicts the people and places that are the subject matter of his newly released book, <em><a href="http://www.rogerballen.com/books/asylum-of-the-birds">Asylum of the Birds</a></em>, published by Thames &amp; Hudson. It follows Roger into a bizarre compound outside of Johannesburg, South Africa, where refugees and escaped mental patients live together with birds and rats. This film contains images that will be hard for you to forget.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>VICE: How do you see your new film interacting with your photographs? Did it change your process to have someone filming while you were taking the pictures?</strong></div>
<div>
  <strong>Roger Ballen: </strong>No, I&rsquo;ve been doing this so long. I&rsquo;ve been doing photos for like 50 years now. I remember once there was a tornado, and I still took my photo. So there&rsquo;s not very much that distracts me; I just focus on what I do.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Wait, can you explain more about the tornado?</strong></div>
<div>
  I remember there was a tornado that blew the roof off, and I still keep taking my pictures.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>As the roof was being ripped off of the building you were in?</strong></div>
<div>
  Yes, I just kept photographing; it didn&rsquo;t distract me. You have to have an extreme sense of concentration and focus, because there&rsquo;s a lot going on in these places and it can be very distracting and very difficult to focus and to put complex symbols together and make a statement that has coherency to it. You have to be able to think on multidimensional levels, and get work done in environments that are potentially very distracting and confusing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>The environment in the asylum looks very confusing. How did these people end up there?</strong></div>
<div>
  They come from various places. Some are refugees from places like Somalia or Congo. Some are runaways from prisons and insane asylums. Some are women with children who don&rsquo;t have a place to go. Others are drifters who come in one night and leave the next day. So it&rsquo;s a mixture of society, all walks of life in South Africa. They are people who are living on the fringe who are not able to adjust to a so-called normal lifestyle.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Do you connect with that?&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
  If I couldn&rsquo;t connect with that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to take any photos. I&rsquo;ve been with this stuff for 30&ndash;40 years. I&rsquo;m not a socio-political photographer, though; I&rsquo;m really a psychologically based photographer. My imagery is about making psychological statements about the human condition, about the human mind. They are way of expressing my relationship to myself. These pictures are really diaries of my own engagement with myself, in another place.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>

</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>So you use these spaces kind of like a studio. You&rsquo;ve got a studio practice going on.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
  I guess you might call it a living studio. When you go outside in New York City with a camera, New York City is the studio. With a camera, you have a thing around your neck, and you put to your head, and you decide what to photograph on the stage.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>What draws you to birds as a subject?</strong></div>
<div>
  Most people are drawn to birds because they have archetypal meanings to them. These meanings are deeply embedded in the human mind. You can see that in the Bible and in Greek mythology. People are drawn to birds because they can lift off into the air; they can fly and get above things. In mythology, they&rsquo;re the animal that links the heavens to the earth. So they&rsquo;re very much an animal of beauty and mystery. Birds carry that symbolism. And then when these birds come into contact with this so called &ldquo;Roger Ballen world,&rdquo; the metaphors for the book are created, and the metaphors for the film are created.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>Do you think the photos are documentary in any way? Is this a document of life in South Africa?</strong></div>
<div>
  There&rsquo;s nothing documentary about anything. Everything is subjective in the way that we live. The more you live and the more you think about things, you realize there is really very little objectivity about anything. Look in the mirror and you say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rdquo;&mdash;but that&rsquo;s mirror reality. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the way you look; it&rsquo;s the way you look through a mirror and the way you comprehend it. Who says that&rsquo;s you? So you really have to deal with what&rsquo;s in front of you. What you&rsquo;re seeing in my photographs are two things: You&rsquo;re seeing camera reality, and then you&rsquo;re seeing the so-called reality transformed through my brain. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;re seeing. There&rsquo;s nothing more, nothing less. It&rsquo;s a documentary of Roger Ballen. Of Roger Ballen&rsquo;s relationship to his world out there.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>What was it like working with Ben Crossman on the film? Because it really looks like your vision, but there&rsquo;s someone else behind the camera in this instance.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>
  Ben is a very, very creative person. He did a good job of transforming my vision through the camera and through the editing and directing. He totally empathized with my vision and my world.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  He worked with the Die Antwoord group for many years, especially in the early days. I met him when I made &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Uee_mcxvrw&amp;">I Fink U Freaky</a>.&rdquo; I realized this was the type of guy I&rsquo;d like to work with in the future. He&rsquo;s half my age. I&rsquo;m 64, and he&rsquo;s in his early 30s. He&rsquo;s got a good dynamic, a good head, very focused. For years I&rsquo;ve tried to find a person to work with on that level, and it just didn&rsquo;t happen. So it was really good to work with Ben.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>In the film you say the places you photograph are not safe, so I&rsquo;m interested in what it&rsquo;s like bringing a film crew with you.</strong></div>
<div>
  There wasn&rsquo;t any crew, just the two of us. There are certain people who can handle these types of places, and other people who can&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s had a lot of experience working in places like these over the years.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>What role does your photographing these people play in their daily lives? It seems like they enjoy performing for you.</strong></div>
<div>
  Some of these people I&rsquo;ve known and kept in contact with for nearly 25 years now. It&rsquo;s been a real relationship with some of the people I work with. Some of my greatest photographs I took the first time I met somebody, and some of the people I&rsquo;ve known for 20 years and never got a good photograph. I never push things. If somebody doesn&rsquo;t want to do something I don&rsquo;t say ask them to do it. My most recent photographs don&rsquo;t involve so many faces in the pictures: It&rsquo;s just a body, a foot, a hand, a back of the head. I&rsquo;m not really doing portraiture anymore. In this work, the people are acting in some way. I think they enjoy it a lot. It breaks their routine; they get some attention&mdash;different than sitting around all day looking at the flies buzz by their head.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  <strong>How do you feel about becoming the subject yourself in this film?</strong></div>
<div>
  The thing is is that I&rsquo;ve had so much media attention over the last 20 years or so, it has no effect on me. I see it as my job to explain what I&rsquo;m doing, to have people better understand what I&rsquo;m doing, to try to get them to relate to the picture.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  I don&rsquo;t take pictures for other people. I&rsquo;ve only done this for 50 years only for one person&mdash;that Roger Ballen. So I can&rsquo;t figure out what other people will do or think of feel.</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;</div>
<div>
  I get a lot of feedback, like, &ldquo;The pictures are great; they&rsquo;ve changed my idea of photography,&rdquo; or &ldquo;They&rsquo;re dark, disturbing; I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo; People sometimes ask me if the pictures disturb me, and I say no. They never disturb me. They are the most exhilarating thing I can do, because they bring me into touch with parts of myself that are enigmatic. They open fragments of who I am to myself, whoever that is. They&rsquo;re cathartic. When people say the pictures are dark, it&rsquo;s really saying they&rsquo;re scared of themselves.&nbsp;</div>

<title>We Went to One of Corey Feldman&#039;s Parties (Again)</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/we-went-to-corey-feldmans-party-again</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 17:25:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140191/corey7-final.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 539px;" /></p>
<p>
  By now, the tale of woe that is <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/i-went-to-corey-feldmans-birthday-party" target="_blank">Corey&rsquo;s Angels</a> is the stuff of legend. We went to his birthday party last year, took a bunch of photos he claimed were doctored to make the party look bad, and then our writer was accused of being a <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/im-being-bullied-by-corey-feldman" target="_blank">pervert</a>. The irony of Corey Feldman accusing someone of sexual deviancy at a party where he charged men $250 to hang around women in lingerie was clearly lost on him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  After a few weeks of Corey furiously tweeting his displeasure over the article, shit died down. Corey went back to retweeting any and all compliments he could find, and all seemed normal&hellip; until we saw an ad for a Corey&rsquo;s Angels Valentine&rsquo;s Day party. Which was, naturally,&nbsp;scheduled for<a href="http://coreysangels.com/party.html" target="_blank"> February 22nd</a>.</p>
<p>
  It&rsquo;d be fair to assume we would have learned our lesson and stayed away this time, but like the producers of <em>Lost Boys 2</em>, we greedily went back for seconds despite having every reason in the world not to. Through cunning, guile, and perseverance (and a $300 entrance fee), we made it back to the Feldmansion.</p>
<p>
  Obviously, under no circumstance, would Corey allow someone from VICE back to one of his &quot;parties,&quot; so I came up with a pseudonym and invented the backstory that my guest was from out of town and looking to get crazy. The party had a dress code demanding that all men wear suits, so I sucked in my gut and squeezed into my Sunday best. Cameras were banned this time around, so I took the cartoonist&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vice.com/author/johnny-ryan" target="_blank">Johnny Ryan</a> with me to draw what happened.</p>
<p>
  If $300 seems like a lot for two grown men to go to a party, you&rsquo;ll be horrified to learn that it almost cost more, as Corey&rsquo;s assistant called me up and tried to claim that the advertised &ldquo;Early Bird Special&rdquo; on their website should have been discontinued before we bought our tickets and that we&#39;d need to give Corey an extra $200. We simply refused to pay more and went on our way.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140192/corey5-final.jpg" style="width: 543px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  As with any sequel, I looked forward to all my favorite characters coming back (Leathery Model, Sad Girl in Glasses, <em>Street Fighter 2</em>&nbsp;machine, DJ Black Eyed Peas, and Brazilian Carnival Dancer), but in an even wackier, more elaborate scenario. For instance, in classic Corey Feldman film <em>Gremlins</em>, the titular monsters wreak havoc on a small town, but in <em>Gremlins 2: The New Batch</em>, the Gremlins are let loose in New York City, take over an entire skyscraper, and stage an elaborate musical number. There&rsquo;s also a female Gremlin with big Gremlin tits, and Corey Feldman never shows up, which is kinda like how my night at Corey&rsquo;s Valentine&rsquo;s Day party played out.</p>
<p>
  We arrived at the party right at 9 PM, hoping that we would beat the rush of people, snag some free beverages, and get a little quality time with Corey. A very friendly man working the door (and by &ldquo;working the door,&rdquo; I mean standing in front of the driveway that leads to the guest house of a large McMansion where Corey lives) explained that there was still a ton of party prep to finish and that they&rsquo;d be ready to let us in in 45 minutes.</p>
<p>
  Forty-five minutes stretched to an hour, and we were finally ushered inside. Despite its being an hour after the scheduled start time, we were half of the number of guests present (there were four, total) and remained as such well past 11 PM.</p>
<p>
  The party planners and security staff (who outnumbered the guests by a significant margin all night) let us know that only the game room was open. They were apologetic, as though there were wings of the house that would eventually be opened that had some inherent value the game room lacked.</p>
<p>
  &ldquo;Game room&rdquo; is probably an inaccurate usage of the term. There was a dartboard, but the room was too small to throw pointy projectiles in. The <em>Street Fighter 2</em> machine was unplugged. There was a pool table, but the Monster Energy Drink towels, plastic plates, and assorted junk on it screamed &ldquo;do not use me for my intended purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140193/corey3-final.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 547px;" /></p>
<p>
  The only other guests at the party were two droopy-eyed young girls firmly planted on a couch, frantically texting hoping to convince someone else to join them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m like, &lsquo;Hey, come to this party in <em>Encino</em>,&rsquo;&rdquo; one said to the other. They were not successful.</p>
<p>
  I was content to stand around drinking lukewarm beverages all night, but the bartender alerted me to the fact that she only had six beers left in the fridge. At first, I was horrified at this clear lack of preparation, but after looking around at the empty room, I realized maybe they were better prepared than I thought.</p>
<p>
  I went back outside to enjoy my drink in peace. The Corey&rsquo;s Angels logo was projected on the side of the house. The cabanas, advertised as available for the low, low price of $2,500 ($1,500 for Early Birds), sat empty. There were some novelty penis whistles and leftover Valentine&rsquo;s candy in each cabana. There were actually cock decorations scattered around everywhere. There was a little dick pi&ntilde;ata sitting next to the pool that, upon closer inspection, was confirmed to be empty.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140194/corey8-final.jpg" style="width: 338px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  Two security guards set up chairs around the driveway, which made me think there&rsquo;d be a fashion show or a processional&mdash;something that would liven up the funereal atmosphere. I asked what the purpose of the chairs was, and I was told that they were &ldquo;for the dance floor.&rdquo; Maybe I don&rsquo;t get out much, but I don&rsquo;t know many clubs that have rows of plastic chairs lining their dance floors. Usually, chairs are for sitting and dance floors are for dancing. The two activities are diametrically opposed, unless the dancing is of the lap variety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Our host, presumably aware of the lack of attendees, stayed sequestered in his upstairs bedroom. Occasionally, he walked by the window that faced the dance floor, stared out at the empty abyss, and went back to frolicking with his Angels. The sounds of giggling and camera shutters were the only noises cutting through the incessant bass of the generic electronic music offered up by our DJ.&nbsp; I had no idea what was going on in that room, but some things are better left to the imagination.</p>
<p>
  Three Asian people arrived around 11:30 (making seven confirmed guests), though none of them were adhering to the dress code. The man was not wearing a suit, and his two female companions had the audacity to wear clothes over their lingerie. I considered informing security, but the fact that I showed up to a Corey&rsquo;s Angels party on time already made me look like a fucking narc. I didn&rsquo;t need to make it worse.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140195/corey2-final.jpg" style="width: 598px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  Another group arrived, and I decided to see if they had any clue as to Corey&rsquo;s whereabouts. A bald man whose claim to fame was &ldquo;working in Beverly Hills&rdquo; said he and his female companion were old friends of Corey&#39;s. &ldquo;He usually comes out around 11:30,&rdquo; he said. By the time we finished discussing scintillating topics like her upcoming clothing line and the joys of high school football, the number of guests had reached around 10 or 15.</p>
<p>
  Then finally, Corey came down the stairs flanked by the glorious Angels, looking like a rockabilly Beetlejuice. He wore a gold-striped suit, had his hair slicked back, and sported giant Bono-esque shades. A certain buzz filled the house, and the living room was finally opened up. I perused his large DVD collection (presumably, Corey hasn&rsquo;t gotten Netflix since he moved).</p>
<p>
  I didn&rsquo;t recognize any of the Angels from the last event, though I should be forgiven for being incapable of telling them apart. I saw Corey give marching orders to an Angel dressed in red lingerie. After he was done telling her he wanted this to be the &ldquo;perfect party,&rdquo; she walked over to us and commenced making small talk, telling us her name was Daisy.&nbsp; She was better at pretending to flirt than I thought she would be. I could see Daisy graduating to the Playboy Mansion in no time. She had moxie.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140196/corey6-final.jpg" style="width: 551px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  A muscular, blonde Angel with massive biceps made a beeline to the <em>Street Fighter 2</em> machine, which had recently been plugged in. I&rsquo;d never called anyone&rsquo;s arms &ldquo;guns&rdquo; earnestly until that evening. Fear seized my body as I realized that if Corey found out I worked for VICE, he&rsquo;d sic his Super Mega Angel on me and she&rsquo;d rip my dick off, salt and cure it, and turn it into cock jerky.</p>
<p>
  All I wanted to do was talk to Corey, maybe get him to tell me what &ldquo;Ascension Millennium&rdquo; means and sign my copy of <em>Coreyography </em>before I went home. <em>Surely, he&rsquo;ll mingle with his few guests as a sign of gratitude, </em>I thought.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140197/corey1-final.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 530px;" /></p>
<p>
  Nope. Corey squirreled himself and his preferred Angels away in a cabana, and he had his guileless assistant run to and from the bar bringing him drinks. He puffed on an e-cigarette and took some &ldquo;official&rdquo; posed photos with the girls.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140198/corey4-final.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  Just as the night was really about to pop off and the attendance figure threatened to break 20, a helicopter started circling the residence, shining a huge spotlight into the front yard. Some of the Angels speculated that it was TMZ trying to get a glimpse at this glamorous, VIP-only event. One really frisky gal shook her breasts in full view of the spotlight, pointed at the helicopter, and screamed to Corey, &ldquo;This is when you <em>know</em> you&rsquo;ve made it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  At first sight of the cops, Corey ran away and hid somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Not long after, a lone police officer approached the house and calmly asked for the music to be turned off. You see, the new Feldmansion is in a quiet residential part of Encino, one full of older, conservative people not used to fancy Hollywood shindigs, and they weren&rsquo;t about to have their night ruined by incessant techno beats. The music was shut off, and we were all forced to go back inside the game room, which comfortably fit those who hadn&rsquo;t already left.</p>
<p>
  Corey never returned. It wasn&rsquo;t enough that he had charged us all for the privilege of standing around his empty house&mdash;he also thought it would be totally cool to run away at the first sign of trouble.</p>
<p>
  Whereas the first Corey&rsquo;s Angels party was a triumphant declaration of presumed relevance with the Feldmeister front and center, this time Corey couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to hang out, and there wasn&rsquo;t even any cake or Brazilian dancers. Like <em>Gremlins 2</em>, this party left me scratching my head. The day after the party, I emailed Corey&#39;s &quot;assistant&quot; to ask about a refund. I am yet to receive a reply.&nbsp;</p>

<title>VICE Premiere: Here Is PUJOL&#039;s New Single</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/here-is-pujols-new-single</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:05:00 +0000</pubDate>

<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139988/jgp-pujol-03.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 360px;" /></p>
<p>
  <iframe frameborder="0" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/129660277%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-PRynj&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>
  How can you run a music site if you have no taste? This is a question I faced last week, when a publicist emailed me with a bee in her bonnet because <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/en_us">Noisey</a>, VICE&#39;s music site, decided <em>not</em> to premiere the new PUJOL single. Seriously, Noisey? You guys aren&rsquo;t into good music? Isn&rsquo;t that, like, your job? I know you&rsquo;d rather spend what little time you&rsquo;ve got left on this dangerous dying sphere talking about Drake, but let me fill you in on a little industry secret: <em>No one gives a rat&rsquo;s sack what Drake is doing or saying,</em>&nbsp;and we&#39;d all rather be vibing to some crunchy-as-fuck garage rock before the sun blows up and we&rsquo;re all dead.</p>
<p>
  Enter&nbsp;<a href="http://pujoldotcom.com/">Daniel&nbsp;Pujol</a>&nbsp;and his newest single, &quot;Pitch Black.&quot; Dan is this scrappy punk kid from Nashville who&rsquo;s played in about a&nbsp;gazillion&nbsp;bands and is one sweat-stained T-shirt away from being a gross&nbsp;crustie. When I first heard &quot;Pitch Black,&quot;&nbsp;my jaw hit the floor and my penis stood up and started doing the Mashed Potato for a minute. It&rsquo;s an old-fashioned rock &#39;n&#39; roll&nbsp;jammy&nbsp;jam made by a dude who knows that pop music should kick your teeth in and be out the door in three minutes or less.</p>
<p>
  The song is off his upcoming record <em>KLUDGE</em>, which will be released through Saddle Creek on May 20. (<a href="http://saddle-creek.com/store/622">You can pre-order that sucker right here</a>.) We asked Dan to tell us what was going on with <a href="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140029/lbj-204back-8x8-300dpi-.jpg">the artwork</a>, and he sent us back a beast of an email that we&#39;re reprinting below in full, not only because it&#39;s too good to edit, but because it does a good job of explaining why we&#39;ve got such a boner for this dude.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/140028/lbj-204-8x8-300dpi-.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 640px;" /></p>
<p>
  <strong>VICE: Hey Dan, what&#39;s going on with your new album cover?<br />
    Daniel Pujol</strong>: I wanted to make an album that sounded completely fictional. Like a cartoon nightmare. Tiny wind-up orchestra.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  One without &quot;RAWKIN&#39;&quot; caricatures of &quot;in the moment authenticity.&quot; Guitar Centered quantification. No goofy loudness war production, etc. No organic cheese crackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  I saw the new Superman and was disappointed by the obsessively realistic special effects. I don&#39;t understand the obsession with realism in media and entertainment, but the fiction and&nbsp;stories are fantastically nonexistent.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  &quot;Oh, man, that CGI Godzilla has a million scales! Oh, man, that guitar amp sounds exactly the way Guitar Center promised me it would!&quot;</p>
<p class="p1">
  I don&#39;t care what Superman would really look like slamming through a building. However, I could be interested in the&nbsp;impossible myth&nbsp;of Superman. Superman could be a personification&nbsp;of human ideals thrown into dilemmas like a litmus test. I don&#39;t care what he eats for breakfast. I want the story. It is more important to me than&nbsp;exactly what that story would look like&nbsp;if it was real.</p>
<p class="p1">
  What does it say about our fantasies if we want them to look HD-realistic? What does it say about our reality if we are entertained by hyper-realistic fantasy?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  I don&#39;t want to &quot;be in the room with the drum set.&quot; Or eat breakfast with Superman. Or smell the singer&#39;s breath in stereo. Or count Godzilla&#39;s scales.</p>
<p class="p1">
  I want to be forced to know there is more than what I can think, see, or feel. That there are things I couldn&#39;t imagine on my own because they exist only in reference to themselves. As&nbsp;creations of someone else. To spite solipsism.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  *These new &quot;chimera&quot; models are hodge-podged from old toy parts initially created by other people.</p>
<p class="p1">
  The LP&#39;s narrative is essentially a Self &quot;breaking up&quot; with his/her Sense Of Self and rediscovering Other People. Just long enough to be seduced by their own identity again. Luckily, the&nbsp;narrator realizes his/her flesh is not his/her identity. And this could be a cycle. Called growing.</p>
<p class="p1">
  There are a lot of &quot;I/you&quot; songs. Is the narrator singing to another person or his/herself or a concept or an idea, etc? I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p class="p1">
  The models help visualize this narrative without &quot;counting Godzilla&#39;s scales.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  I created an exercise based off of the Burroughs/Bowie &quot;cut-up&quot; method. I go to a specific used-toy store. They have a box of broken toys. I grab handfuls of old, dirty, toy parts and try to make&nbsp;&quot;sense&quot; of them by creating an &quot;action figure.&quot; As I sort through them, an idea that the figure could personify begins to form. Then I Frankenstein it together. I give the abstract concept a body,&nbsp;the same way a joke has a punchline:</p>
<p class="p1">
  Things I see or read about<br />
  People turning into how they act<br />
  What a feeling would look like with a body<br />
  Attitudes<br />
  Behaviors<br />
  Ideals<br />
  News Headlines<br />
  Feelings<br />
  Total Fiction<br />
  Personification of Thoughts, Desires, Fears<br />
  Personified fear of things we almost understand<br />
  &quot;I&quot; and &quot;You&quot; within the same person<br />
  Turning Misbehaviors Into Objects<br />
  Dirty Toys, used playthings endlessly repairing themselves, being abused&nbsp;and&nbsp;enjoyed by the world... yuck!</p>
<p class="p1">
  They are empowered but also limited by their body.&nbsp;This is one of the reason why they are funny to me. The Sacred Heart of Jesus has to ride on a golden saddle of only two muscular legs.&nbsp;The legs are impressive, but can&#39;t gallop. He can&#39;t GET anywhere. Looks great on paper, but getting around is more complicated. So he must settle for Sacred Heart the Human Kindness&nbsp;Kind. Net gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  These models are the characters of the narrator&#39;s inner monologue.&nbsp;His/her OWN Superman Reboot. But its birth into our reality is grotesque and exists in reference only to the narrator&#39;s&nbsp;mind, life experience, his/her&nbsp;&quot;myth.&quot;</p>
<p class="p1">
  They are Frankenstein&#39;s made from the toy graveyard of other human&#39;s dream, ideas, and playthings. Assuming thoughts and feelings are &quot;toys&quot; for humans to &quot;play&quot; with.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  The models are the supporting cast of Someone rebooting their &quot;Ideal-Self.&quot;</p>
<p class="p1">
  Is he/she committing the same mistake as the Superman Reboot? Or is it all he/she knows is possible because of the world he/she experiences? And it is the best he/she can do.</p>
<p class="p1">
  *I also became interested in the history of horror and folklore. Monsters being created as explanations of things existing on the cusp of human understanding. Demons to vampires to&nbsp;aliens to inter-dimensional shadow people. This determined the look of some of these models. Contemporary fear.</p>
<p class="p1">
  Is conspiracy theory the new folklore of horror? Lizard people, shadow people, chip implants, MRAP police state, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">
  Thanks, Dan!</p>

<title>Neither Big nor Easy: Riding a Parade Float with Mardi Gras&#039;s First Rock Band</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/riding-along-with-mardi-grass-first-rock-band</link>
<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:35:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>
<img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139934/01---sue-ford-close-up.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  In 1987, singer and guitarist Sue Ford moved from Boston to New Orleans and became firmly entrenched in the city&rsquo;s rock scene. She&rsquo;s currently married to Jimmy Ford, a drummer, former bar owner, and one-time manager for acts like the dB&#39;s and Richard Hell. The couple plays together in the heavy rock band&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reverbnation.com/dinola" target="_blank">DiNOLA</a>, but Sue is perhaps best known as the woman who first injected rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll into the city&rsquo;s traditional Mardi Gras parades.</p>
<p>
  Sue rightfully felt the parades didn&rsquo;t reflect the wide variety of music New Orleans offers, and so she did her damnedest to get her all-female rock band&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nola.com/mardigras/index.ssf/2008/01/ladies_of_pink_slip_rock_mardi.html" target="_blank">Pink Slip</a>&nbsp;onto a float. Her idea to screw with traditions stretching back hundreds of years met with resistance until 2000, when New Orleans&rsquo;s first all-female parade krewe,&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="http://kreweofmuses.org" target="_blank">Muses</a>, put out a call for female musicians and bands outside of the jazz and blues genres, which normally dominate the festivities.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139939/05---guy-getting-ready-with-big-bags-of-beads.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">
  <i>A man prepares a float&mdash;loaded with beads&mdash;for the Mardi Gras parade in&nbsp;</i><em>Chalmette Lousiana, on February 22.</em></p>
<p>
  Nowadays, Pink Slip rocks several parades every Mardi Gras season. On the more crowded routes, fans hold signs demanding &ldquo;Show Us Your Pink!&rdquo; Police officers occassionally request the DiNOLA song&nbsp;<a href="http:// http://www.reverbnation.com/dinola/songs#" target="_blank">&ldquo;I Wanna Die in New Orleans,&rdquo;</a> which the Fords wrote with Dave Catching, who owns the famed <a href="http://www.ranchodelaluna.com" target="_blank">Rancho de la Luna</a> studios in Joshua Tree and who often joins Pink Slip on the parade route. Other frequent special guests include former White Zombie bassist Sean Yseult,&nbsp;Tony Maimone&nbsp;of Pere Ubu, and New Orleans&rsquo;s legendary singer-songwriter&nbsp;Susan Cowsill, of the Cowsill family band.</p>
<p>
  Over the years, all the other female musicians who were in Pink Slip have dropped out or been, well, given the pink slip. Eric Laws of DiNOLA now plays lead guitar, and Eddie Payne plays bass. After serving as Pink Slip&rsquo;s roadie for six years, Sue&rsquo;s husband Jimmy plays drums on the float while simultaneously running sound.</p>
<p>
  When I talked to her for a <a href="http://www.offbeat.com/2012/02/01/parading-club-bands/" target="_blank">2012&nbsp;<em>OffBeat&nbsp;</em>magazine piece</a>&nbsp;I wrote&nbsp;about her role in Mardi Gras, Sue told me about the process of selecting companions for this annual adventure: &ldquo;When picking my krewe, it&rsquo;s like going on a canoe trip. First, you&rsquo;re thinking about all the great friends you want to bring. Then it starts raining and the canoe gets stuck, and you think, &lsquo;OK, who would not deal with this well?&rsquo; and you start crossing people off that list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  So I was honored to be chosen as&nbsp;Pink Slip&rsquo;s guest bartender for the&nbsp;Knights of Nemesis&nbsp;parade, on the afternoon of February 22 in outlying Chalmette, beyond the Lower Ninth Ward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">
  <i>Pink Slip on the band&#39;s float</i></p>
<p>
  Chalmette&nbsp;is very different from the New Orleans beloved by tourists. I&rsquo;ve always been fond of Chalmations, as the residents are called, though Chalmette can look a lot like suburbia. Instead of charmingly crammed-together shotgun homes, Chalmations live in regular middle-class houses on double lots with army-green boats round back. In place of music clubs, Chalmette has strip malls and chain stores, and an amazing array of drive-through daiquiri shops.</p>
<p>
  I step out of my truck in the Walmart parking lot near the parade&rsquo;s start and take in the sight of St. Bernard Parish&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.olpsschool.org/Fair/2013MissTomatoQueenContract.pdf" target="_blank">Creole Tomato Queen</a> adjusting her crown and sash and another lady spray-painting purple fleurs-de-lis onto a horse while telling her friends how she used to live in New Orleans proper but &ldquo;city life just isn&rsquo;t for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  Pink Slip hasn&rsquo;t arrived, yet so I walk over to where the other floats are lined up. Heavy-duty speakers strapped to floats blast Drake, &ldquo;Pour Some Sugar on Me,&rdquo; Three Dog Night, and the&nbsp;Mardi Gras Indian anthem <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHCKAKoA4Ys" target="_blank">&ldquo;New Suit.&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;Above me men load colorful floats with bags and bags of beads and toys to throw. Emptied bags dance in the wind all around the parking lot. More than one guy is wearing <em>Duck Dynasty</em> gear, and one has a football helmet on because he&rsquo;s on blood thinners, he tells me&mdash;getting hit with beads could be fatal.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139960/04---blood-thinners.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 478px;" /></p>
<p>
  This will be the first year for Pink Slip&rsquo;s new float, which is far nicer than the smaller vehicle they rented from the Lyon&rsquo;s Club&nbsp;for the last 13 years.&nbsp;This one has more space, a sweet little Honda generator, and a private bathroom featuring a bucket full of kitty litter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  With ten minutes left till parade time, Jimmy and Sue mount two heavy, expensive speakers onto the roof and slide similar monitors into a compartment above where Sue will sing. Sue rushes to screw the soundboard into the float in such a way that Jimmy can run sound while also playing drums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139964/5-5---sue-working-in-pink-jacket.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
  Everyone&rsquo;s dressed in rocker gear with pink accessories, while bass player&nbsp;Eddie wears an amazing suit he&rsquo;s adorned with fuzzy balls and thousands of plastic googly eyes.&nbsp;The project took him two years to complete.&nbsp;&ldquo;I would force myself to watch shitty movies that I didn&rsquo;t have to pay attention to, just so I could sit with the glue gun,&rdquo; he tells me. Ed&rsquo;s tall pointed hat is sort of a Muppet version of the <a href="http://www.myneworleans.com/Acadiana-Profile/December-January-2014/The-Story-Behind-Cajun-Mardi-Gras-Masks/" target="_blank">traditional&nbsp;capuchin</a>&nbsp;worn by krewes in the Mamou&nbsp;region of southern Louisiana&mdash;the kind of hat that makes crowds stop and point and forces teenagers to look up from their iPhones.</p>
<p>
  As we prepare to finally roll I make sure everyone has a drink. Jimmy warns me that this U-turn of a parade route takes four to five hours to complete, meaning we&rsquo;ll have to pace ourselves with the drinks. Like Mardi Gras itself, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Our cooler is full of tall boys plus six thermoses full of mandarin-flavored vodka and soda with the smallest splash of cranberry juice&mdash;a drink known in more than a couple of local bars as a &ldquo;Jimmy Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139966/00---Eddie-in-suit.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 353px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  A bit before&nbsp;2 PM we are finally off, the float subtly swaying like a boat as it moves down the road. Almost no one in the Chalmette crowd is costumed,&nbsp;though their necks are draped with beads, the traditional Mardi Gras currency. We&rsquo;re noticeably not besieged by beggars like the floats in front of us and behind. A few in the crowd observe that I don&rsquo;t have an instrument in my hands and gesture for some kind of offering like ducks lusting after breadcrusts. &ldquo;Giving them the gift of music is good enough,&rdquo; Sue replies when I ask if they have anything on board I can throw.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139971/07---dad-and-son.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p>
  I&rsquo;m not feeling Pink Slip&rsquo;s cover of the late-period U2 song &ldquo;Get on Your Boots,&rdquo; but Loverboy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Working for the Weekend&rdquo; slays the crowd. I am about to request they play DiNOLA&rsquo;s heaviest song,&nbsp;&ldquo;Vaporizer,&rdquo;&nbsp;when Sue calls it out. After it&rsquo;s over, someone in the crowd hands Erik up a beer. Jimmy advises him not to let it go to his head. Soon afterward, the parade stalls out and our float comes to a stop.</p>
<p>
  Pink Slip continue to play for about ten minutes before a cop comes over and explains that one of the float&rsquo;s tractor drivers got into an argument with his krewe and abandoned his duties. They were now looking for someone else who could drive a tractor. Eventually, somehow, the parade rolls on.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139972/juan-s-bar-float.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
  This daytime Chalmette route lacks the debauchery associated with Mardi Gras (tit flashing as a tradition has almost disappeared, even on Bourbon Street, thanks to digital cameras and the internet; you never know which pictures are going to make you infamous). The modest Chalmation crowd is made up mostly of families of every size, shape, and color. But though things start out quiet, as time passes folks get visibly drunker and wilder. More air guitarists step up. Dads bounce little girls on sloppy shoulders. In lieu of beads I hand out a few tall boys to those in the crowd wearing costumes or otherwise clearly deserving&nbsp;of <em>something</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139975/10---one-armed-man-and-baby.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p>
  At around three, Pink Slip plays &ldquo;Fashion&rdquo; by David Bowie, and we spot the blue-and-white marching band at the start of the parade passing us on the other side of the neutral ground. Then it&#39;s my turn to take the stage and sing Madonna&rsquo;s &ldquo;Vogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
  I&rsquo;ve been singing in front of audiences since I was 15, but performing on the float feels strange. People stare and point; I feel like more of an object. When the song is done, Sue pats the top of her head to signal the band to start the song again &ldquo;from the top.&rdquo; Moving along the route you could play the same tune over and over, and no one but the band would even notice.</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139976/11---me-singing-fangs.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 853px;" /></p>
<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  At&nbsp;3:30, we finally U-turn around the neutral ground to the tune of War&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cisco Kid.&rdquo; The float&rsquo;s floor is littered with plastic googly eyes that have dropped off Eddie&rsquo;s hat&mdash;I pick them up so he can glue them back on later. Then our day takes a sudden turn. As I sit back down, I watch as the big monitor slides free of its moorings and hits Sue in the head. She continues singing, somehow, but her voice slows down like a dying vinyl record as she gradually slumps down in a chair.</p>
<p>
  The band stops. The truck stops. The float stops. The parade behind us stops, and the float ahead of us rolls away. Everyone rushes to Sue, who claims she&rsquo;s fine. Her hair isn&rsquo;t bloody, at least. I wrap up some ice for her head as she moves to the back of the float to lie down across the coolers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  This means I have to sing again. I don&rsquo;t know many songs on the band&rsquo;s set list, so we play ZZ Top&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sharp Dressed Man,&rdquo; the same four verses, on a loop, for about 15 minutes. The crowd cheers but the band is looking back worriedly at Sue, who is holding ice on her head with the woozy smile of someone who just got bonked on the head with a roughly 70-pound speaker. She gives me a thumbs-up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <img alt="" src="http://assets.vice.com/content-images/contentimage/139981/red-shirt-girl-gettin-down.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /></p>
<p>
  Finally Sue, against all common sense, stands back up to reclaim her microphone. Holding ice to her head she sings &ldquo;Dragging the Line&rdquo; by Tommy James and the Shondells, chosen because it includes the refrain &ldquo;I feel fine.&rdquo; The set list then shifts to original DiNOLA tunes&mdash;which, truth be told, sound better than the band&rsquo;s covers&mdash;until finally we pull back into the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>
  In the end, no one drank more than four drinks. The cooler is still stocked with food the band never had time to eat, beers they didn&rsquo;t drink, and three full thermoses of Jimmy Fords.</p>
<p>

<p class="photo_caption">

<p>
  Jimmy finally has time now to worry over Sue. &ldquo;She got&nbsp;two&nbsp;different concussions during Mardi Gras last year,&rdquo; he tells me, kissing his wife&rsquo;s still-throbbing head. &ldquo;She got smacked in the head with a piece of wood while working on the float, and then someone hit her in the head with a giant bag of beads.
